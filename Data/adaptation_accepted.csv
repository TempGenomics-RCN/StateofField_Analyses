4839,NA,Evolutionary dynamics of hybridization and introgression following the recent colonization of Glossy Ibis (Aves: Plegadis falcinellus) into the New World,"Oswald, JA; Harvey, MG; Remsen, RC; Foxworth, DU; Dittmann, DL; Cardiff, SW; Brumfield, RT","Geographic range shifts can cause secondary contact and hybridization between closely related species, revealing mechanisms of species formation and integrity. These dynamics typically play out in restricted geographic regions, but highly vagile species may experience major distributional changes resulting in broad areas of contact. The Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) is a dispersive waterbird of the Old World and Australia that colonized eastern North America in the early 19th century and came into contact with the native White-faced Ibis (P. chihi). Putative hybrids between the two species have been observed across North America. To examine the population genomic consequences of this natural invasion, we sequenced 4,616 ultraconserved elements from 66 individuals sampled across the distributions of falcinellus, chihi, and the Puna Ibis (P. ridgwayi) of South America. We found genomic differentiation among the three species. Loci with high sequence divergence were often shared across all pairwise species comparisons, were associated with regions of high nucleotide diversity, and were concentrated on the Z chromosome. We detected signals of genetic admixture between chihi and falcinellus in individuals both near and far from their core area of sympatry. Genomic cline analyses revealed evidence of greater introgression into falcinellus from chihi, but we found little evidence for selection against hybrids. We also found signals of admixture between ridgwayi and South American populations of chihi. Our results indicate vagile species can experience pervasive introgression upon secondary contact, although we suggest these dynamics may be more ephemeral than the stable hybrid zones often observed in less dispersive organisms.",oswaldj3@gmail.com,2019,10.1111/mec.15008,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,JW,ACS,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,uses museum samples but lumps them together with modern samples
2490,NA,"The temporal and spatial scale of microevolution: fine-scale colour pattern variation in the Lake Erie watersnake, Nerodia sipedon insularum","Ray, JM; King, RB","Question: What is the temporal and spatial scale of microevolution? Hypotheses: The combined effects of natural selection and gene flow result in variation in heritable traits on fine spatial and geographic scales. Organism: The Lake Erie watersnake, Nerodia sipedon insularum. Field site: US and Canadian islands in western Lake Erie. Methods: We tested for variation in colour pattern frequency within islands, among islands, and over time using data from nearly annual censuses conducted since 1980, museum specimens, and published sources. We compared F-ST for a presumptive major colour pattern locus to F-ST for allozyme loci to determine whether spatial variation exceeded that expected by chance. We computed effective population size (:V,) based on temporal frequency changes in presumptive colour pattern alleles to determine whether temporal variation exceeded that expected by chance (N-e significantly less than infinity). Conclusions: Morph frequencies did not differ significantly within islands or between islands separated by short distances. Morph frequencies did sometimes differ significantly among distant islands and among sampling periods from 1980 to the present, but no more than expected by chance. In contrast, a marked change in morph frequency occurred between historic (prior to 1961) and recent (1980-2003) samples. Possible mechanisms include changes in the strength of selection (due to changes in predator assemblages and visual environments) and rates of gene flow (due to changes in island watersnake population size).",jray@odu.edu,2006,NA,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,temporal-genetics,JW,ACS,reject,non-genomic,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,freshwater,Reptilia,"Canada, USA",Lake Erie,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"730 (Bauman and Metter, 1977)",opportunistic,natural,competition,env_variation,human_exploitation,chronic,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,uses allozymes

(Diptera: Syrphidae), was studied in both wild and captive populations from southeastern Europe. Wild specimens from a natural protected habitat (with low human impact), field crop habitat (semisynanthropic condition), and intensive pig farming habitat (synanthropic condition) were compared with a laboratory colony reared on artificial media. An integrative approach was applied based on allozyme loci, cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial DNA, wing traits (size and shape), and abdominal color patterns. Our results indicate that the fourth and eighth generations of the laboratory colony show a severe lack of genetic diversity compared with natural populations. Reduced genetic diversity in subsequent generations (F4 and F8) of the laboratory colony was found to be linked with phenotypic divergence. Loss of genetic variability associated with phenotypic differentiation in laboratory samples suggests a founder effect, followed by stochastic genetic processes and inbreeding. Hence, our results have implications for captive bred Eristalis flies, which have been used in crop pollination and biodegradation of organic waste under synanthropic conditions.",vesna.milankov@dbe.uns.ac.rs,2014,10.1603/EC13243,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,historical-dna,JW,ACS,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
1974,NA,Microgeographical population structure and adaptation in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua: spatio-temporal insights from gene-associated DNA markers,"Poulsen, NA; Hemmer-Hansen, J; Loeschcke, V; Carvalho, GR; Nielsen, EE","Recent technical advances have stimulated studies on spatial scales of adaptive genetic variation in marine fishes. However, very few studies have combined spatial and temporal sampling to investigate adaptive genetic structuring at local and microgeographical scales, i.e. scales at which neutral genetic markers have typically revealed very limited levels of population structure. In the present study we analyzed 92 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from several sampling sites within the North Sea and adjacent areas. To test for temporal stability, we included long-and short-term (i.e. from 24 to 38 and from 8 to 11 yr, respectively) temporally replicated samples from a subset of populations. As expected, we found very low levels of neutral genetic population structure (F-ST = 0.003). Three specific loci, however, showed highly elevated levels of genetic differentiation. Interestingly, these loci were identical to loci previously found to display signals of adaptive evolution on larger spatial scales. Analysis of historical samples revealed long-term temporally stable patterns of both neutral and adaptive divergence between some populations, indicating long-term temporal adaptive stability driven by strong local selection. In an environmentally dynamic area, on the other hand, patterns of genetic structuring were more variable. Overall, our results not only suggest separation of populations under both evolutionary and ecological paradigms, but also illustrate the usefulness of the spatio-temporal approach for making inferences about the dynamics and geographical distribution of adaptive genetic variation in natural populations.",jhh@aqua.dtu.dk,2011,10.3354/meps09246,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,historical-dna,KF,ACS,accept,accept,empirical,adaptation,connectivity,NA,NA,no,marine,Actinopterygii,"Norway,Denmark,UK","57.15/11.35.56.45/07.30.57.45/05.30, 54.29/00.02.50.47/0.29, 58.00/03.00.59.58/05.15, 62.53/06.18.60.56/08.52, 57.10/08.20, 55.17/03.39, NA, NA.NA","2007.01.01, 2006.01.01, 2003.01.01, 2002.01.01, 1999.01.01, 1996.01.01, 1978.01.01, 1965.01.01","40.40.40, 40.40, 40.40, 40.40, 40, 40, 32, 33.32",2,1965.01.01,2003.01.01,2739 (FishBase),opportunistic,natural,env_variation,NA,NA,chronic,SNP,gills,NA,chelex,Agena MassARRAY,NA,RC: 2 time points/location

Reintroduction of Coho salmon to the interior Columbia River (Wenatchee River) using lower river stocks placed selective pressures on the new colonizers due to substantial differences with their original habitat such as migration distance and navigation of six additional hydropower dams. We used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to genotype 5,392 SNPs in reintroduced Coho salmon in the Wenatchee River over four generations to test for signals of temporal structure and adaptive variation. Temporal genetic structure among the three broodlines of reintroduced fish was evident among the initial return years (2000, 2001, and 2002) and their descendants, which indicated levels of reproductive isolation among broodlines. Signals of adaptive variation were detected from multiple outlier tests and identified candidate genes for further study.

Herring spawn mostly in fall or spring, and genomic differentiation was recently detected between these groups. Here we used a subset of this differentiation, 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the temporal dynamics of this local adaptation and the applicability of SNP subsets in stock assessment. We showed remarkable temporal stability of genomic differentiation corresponding to spawning season, between samples taken a decade apart (2005 N = 90 vs. 2014 N = 71) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and new evidence of limited interbreeding between spawning components. We also examined an understudied and overexploited herring population in Bras d'Or lake (N = 97); using highly reduced SNP panels (N-SNPs > 6), we verified little-known sympatric spawning populations within this unique inland sea. These results describe consistent local adaptation, arising from asynchronous reproduction in a migratory and dynamic marine species.

Hybrid zone centre and width were also determined for samples collected across the zone 40 years ago from morphological data. The present and past clines were compared and provided support for stability in hybrid zone location and width, and the evolutionary implications of this are discussed.

We also found the population of 1968 to have the pattern of wing venation to be more similar to A. m. scutellata than the current population. The mitochondrial DNA of European origin, which was very common in the 1968 population, was not found in the current population, indicating selective pressure replacing the European with the African genome in this tropical region.

4645,NA,Coexistence mechanisms and the paradox of the plankton: quantifying selection from noisy data,"Fox, JW; Nelson, WA; McCauley, E","Many species of phytoplankton typically co-occur within a single lake, as do many zooplankton species (the """"paradox of the plankton''). Long-term co-occurrence suggests stable coexistence. Coexistence requires that species be equally """"fit'' on average. Coexistence mechanisms can equalize species' long-term average fitnesses by reducing fitness differences to low levels at all times, and by causing species' relative fitness to fluctuate over time, thereby reducing differences in time-averaged fitness. We use recently developed time series analysis techniques drawn from population genetics to estimate the strength of net selection (time-averaged selection over a year) and fluctuating selection (an index of the variation in selection throughout the year) in natural plankton communities. Analysis of 99 annual time series of zooplankton species dynamics and 49 algal time series reveals that within-year net selection generally is statistically significant but ecologically weak. Rates of net selection are; 10 times faster in laboratory competition experiments than in nature, indicating that natural coexistence mechanisms are strong. Most species experience significant fluctuating selection, indicating that fluctuation-dependent mechanisms may contribute to coexistence. Within-year net selection increases with enrichment, implying that among-year coexistence mechanisms such as trade-offs between competitive ability and resting egg production are especially important at high enrichment. Fluctuating selection also increases with enrichment but is independent of the temporal variance of key abiotic factors, suggesting that fluctuating selection does not emerge solely from variation in abiotic conditions, as hypothesized by Hutchinson. Nor does fluctuating selection vary among lake-years because more variable abiotic conditions comprise stronger perturbations to which species exhibit frequency-dependent responses, since models of this mechanism fail to reproduce observed patterns of fluctuating selection. Instead, fluctuating selection may arise from internally generated fluctuations in relative fitness, as predicted by models of fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanisms.

We here address these issues with a series of genome scans in four overfished populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) studied over an 80-year period. Screening of >1000 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 77 loci that showed highly elevated levels of differentiation, likely as an effect of directional selection, in either time, space or both. Exploratory analysis suggested that temporal allele frequency shifts at certain loci may correlate with local temperature variation and with life history changes suggested to be fisheries induced. Interestingly, however, largely nonoverlapping sets of loci were temporal outliers in the different populations and outliers from the 1928 to 1960 period showed almost complete stability during later decades. The contrasting microevolutionary trajectories among populations resulted in sequential shifts in spatial outliers, with no locus maintaining elevated spatial differentiation throughout the study period. Simulations of migration coupled with observations of temporally stable spatial structure at neutral loci suggest that population replacement or gene flow alone could not explain all the observed allele frequency variation. Thus, the genetic changes are likely to at least partly be driven by highly dynamic temporally and spatially varying selection.

In eastern North America, planning for wolf population restoration is complicated by the disputed historic distributions of two wolf species: the Old World-evolved gray wolf (Canis lupus) and the New World-evolved eastern wolf (C. lycaon). We used genetic and morphometric data from 4- to 500-year-old Canis samples excavated in London, Ontario, Canada to help clarify the historic range of these two wolf species in the eastern temperate forests of North America. We isolated DNA and sequenced the mitochondrial control region and found that none of the samples were of gray wolf origin. Two of the DNA sequences corresponded to those found in present day coyotes (C. latrans), but morphometric comparisons show an eastern wolf, not coyote, origin.

Polymorphism in the couch potato gene has been implicated in genetic variation for this diapause trait. Using a collection of 20 populations from Florida to Canada and 11 collections from 3 years in a Pennsylvania orchard, we estimated the allele frequencies for 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the couch potato gene. These include the specific polymorphism associated with diapause inducability. We find that the SNP polymorphism, 48034(A/T), is correlated with latitude and its frequencies are predicted by the incidence of diapause trait. We find that the clinal patterns for cpo SNPs sampled in 1997 are similar to the same SNPs sampled in 2009-2010. SNPs that show apparent associations with cpo expression are also clinal with the low-expression allele increasing in frequency, as would be predicted from functional knockout studies of cpo. Finally, we see a significant pattern where the frequency of the diapause-causing allele drops in frequency during the summer season, consistent with the drop in the incidence of the diapause trait.

In this sense, transcriptomic analyses can help to identify genes potentially related to thermal responses. We here investigated, via RNA-seq, whole-transcriptomic responses to increased and decreased temperatures in a thermophilous keystone sea urchin,Arbacia lixula, whose populations are increasing in the Mediterranean. This species is a key driver of benthic communities' structure due to its grazing activity. We found a strong response to experimentally induced cold temperature (7 degrees C), with 1,181 differentially expressed transcripts relative to the control condition (13 degrees C), compared to only 179 in the warm (22 degrees C) treatment. A total of 84 (cold treatment) and three (warm treatment) gene ontology terms were linked to the differentially expressed transcripts. At 7 degrees C the expression of genes encoding different heat shock proteins (HSPs) was upregulated, together with apoptotic suppressor genes (e.g.,Bcl2), genes involved in the infection response and/or pathogen-recognition (e.g., echinoidin) and ATP-associated genes, while protein biosynthesis and DNA replication pathways were downregulated. At 22 degrees C neither HSPs induction nor activation of the previously mentioned pathways were detected, with the exception of some apoptotic-related activities that were upregulated.

Ecological niche modelling revealed that temperature is a central predictive factor in the spatial distribution of pure parental species and their hybrids and explains spatial and temporal variation in the frequency of neutral genetic markers in hybrid populations. Among populations of parentals and hybrids, both thermal tolerance and heat-shock protein expression vary strongly, indicating that spatial and temporal structure is likely driven by adaptation to local thermal environments.

2176,NA,Multiple losses of flight and recent speciation in steamer ducks,"Fulton, TL; Letts, B; Shapiro, B","Steamer ducks (Tachyeres) comprise four species, three of which are flightless. The flightless species are believed to have diverged from a flying common ancestor during the Late Pleistocene; however, their taxonomy remains contentious. Of particular interest is the previously unstudied population of flying steamer ducks in the Falkland Islands. We present the first genetic data from this insular population, and illustrate that the flying and flightless steamer ducks on the Falkland Islands are genetically indistinguishable, in contrast to their traditional classification as separate species. The three species that reside in continental South America form a genetically distinct lineage from the Falkland Island ducks. The Falkland steamer ducks diverged from their continental relatives 2.2-0.6 million years ago, coincident with a probable land bridge connecting the Falkland Islands to the mainland. The three continental species share a common ancestor approximately 15 000 years ago, possibly owing to isolation during a recent glacial advance. The continental steamer duck species are not reciprocally monophyletic, but show some amount of genetic differentiation between them. Each lineage of Tachyeres represents a different stage between flight and flightlessness. Their phylogenetic relationships suggest multiple losses of flight and/or long-term persistence of mixed-flight capability. As such, steamer ducks may provide a model system to study the evolution of flightlessness.",beth.shapiro@psu.edu,2012,10.1098/rspb.2011.2599,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,museum-dna,AAS,ACS,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,uses museum samples but lumps them together with modern samples
3868,NA,Slow DNA Loss in the Gigantic Genomes of Salamanders,"Sun, C; Arriaza, JRL; Mueller, RL","Evolutionary changes in genome size result from the combined effects of mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Insertion and deletion mutations (indels) directly impact genome size by adding or removing sequences. Most species lose more DNA through small indels (i.e., similar to 1-30 bp) than they gain, which can result in genome reduction over time. Because this rate of DNA loss varies across species, small indel dynamics have been suggested to contribute to genome size evolution. Species with extremely large genomes provide interesting test cases for exploring the link between small indels and genome size; however, most large genomes remain relatively unexplored. Here, we examine rates of DNA loss in the tetrapods with the largest genomes-the salamanders. We used low-coverage genomic shotgun sequence data from four salamander species to examine patterns of insertion, deletion, and substitution in neutrally evolving non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon sequences. For comparison, we estimated genome-wide DNA loss rates in non-LTR retrotransposon sequences from five other vertebrate genomes: Anolis carolinensis, Danio rerio, Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens, and Xenopus tropicalis. Our results show that salamanders have significantly lower rates of DNA loss than do other vertebrates. More specifically, salamanders experience lower numbers of deletions relative to insertions, and both deletions and insertions are skewed toward smaller sizes. On the basis of these patterns, we conclude that slow DNA loss contributes to genomic gigantism in salamanders. We also identify candidate molecular mechanisms underlying these differences and suggest that natural variation in indel dynamics provides a unique opportunity to study the basis of genome stability.",Rachel.Mueller@colostate.edu,2012,10.1093/gbe/evs103,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,museum-dna,AAS,ACS,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
5074,NA,The environmental and genetic determinants of chick telomere length in Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor),"Belmaker, A; Hallinger, KK; Glynn, RA; Winkler, DW; Haussmann, MF","Conditions during early life can have dramatic effects on adult characteristics and fitness. However, we still know little about the mechanisms that mediate these relationships. Telomere shortening is one possibility. Telomeres are long sequences of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes. They shorten naturally throughout an individual's life, and individuals with short telomeres tend to have poorer health and reduced survival. Given this connection between telomere length (TL) and fitness, natural selection should favor individuals that are able to retain longer telomeres for a greater portion of their lives. However, the ability of natural selection to act on TL depends on the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence TL. In this study, we experimentally enlarged broods of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to test the effects of demanding early-life conditions on TL, while simultaneously cross-fostering chicks to estimate heritable genetic influences on TL. In addition, we estimated the effects of parental age and chick sex on chick TL. We found that TL is highly heritable in Tree Swallow chicks, and that the maternal genetic basis for TL is stronger than is the paternal genetic basis. In contrast, the experimental manipulation of brood size had only a weak effect on chick TL, suggesting that the role of environmental factors in influencing TL early in life is limited. There was no effect of chick sex or parental age on chick TL. While these results are consistent with those reported in some studies, they are in conflict with others. These disparate conclusions might be attributable to the inherent complexity of telomere dynamics playing out differently in different populations or to study-specific variation in the age at which subjects were measured.",belmakera@tauex.tau.ac.il,2019,10.1002/ece3.5386,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,AAS,KF,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No temporal data collection/comparison between years

This is the second example of the CHDZ-1 gene being correlated with fitness, a previous study having established that Moorhens Gallinula chloropus carrying the rare Z* allele have reduced survival. In Godwits, however, carriers of the Z* allele (374 bp) fared better than those with the more frequent Z allele (378 bp) with respect to body mass, plumage ornamentation, reproductive parameters and habitat quality. The Z* allele was found in 14% of 251 adult birds from nature reserves, but was absent from 33 birds breeding in intensively managed agricultural lands. Males and females with the Z* allele had less extensive breeding plumage, and females had a higher body mass, bred earlier and had larger eggs. There were no significant differences in annual survival between birds with and without the Z* allele. DNA isolated from museum skins demonstrated that this polymorphism was present at low frequency in 1929. We speculate that strong asymmetrical overdominance may explain the low frequency of the Z* allele and that genetic linkage to causal genes might be an explanation for the phenotypic correlations.

Here, we report the consequences of human-mediated admixis among differentially coloured populations of the endemic cichlid fish Tropheus moorii from several localities that have accidentally been put in sympatry in a small harbour bay in the very south of Lake Tanganyika. We analysed the phenotypes (coloration) and genotypes (mitochondrial control region and five microsatellite loci) of almost 500 individuals, sampled over 3 consecutive years. Maximum-likelihood-based parenthood analyses and Bayesian inference of population structure revealed that significantly more juveniles are the product of within-colour-morph matings than could be expected under the assumption of random mating. Our results clearly indicate a marked degree of assortative mating with respect to the different colour morphs. Therefore, we postulate that sexual selection based on social interactions and female mate choice has played an important role in the formation and maintenance of the different colour morphs in Tropheus, and is probably common in other maternally mouthbrooding cichlids as well.",walter.salzburger@uni-konstanz.de,2006,10.1098/rspb.2005.3321,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,museum-dna,AAS,KF,accept,accept,empirical,adaptation,NA,NA,NA,yes,freshwater,Actinopterygii,Zambia,Mpulungu,"2001.02.01, 2000.02.01, 1999.02.01","150, 189, 118",3,1999.02.01,2001.02.01,621,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,NA,NA,acute,mtDNA_seq,skin,ethanol,Bruford_etal_1998,NA,PCR,Both mtDNA and microsats.

But disease can also act as a selective pressure on survivors, driving the evolution of resistance or tolerance. Bat white-nose syndrome (WNS) is a rapidly spreading wildlife disease in North America. The fungus causing the disease invades skin tissues of hibernating bats, resulting in disruption of hibernation behavior, premature energy depletion, and subsequent death. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate changes in allele frequencies within a population of Myotis lucifugus in eastern North America to search for genetic resistance to WNS. Our results show low F-ST values within the population across time, i.e., prior to WNS (Pre-WNS) compared to the population that has survived WNS (Post-WNS). However, when dividing the population with a geographical cut-off between the states of Pennsylvania and New York, a sharp increase in values on scaffold GL429776 is evident in the Post-WNS samples. Genes present in the diverged area are associated with thermoregulation and promotion of brown fat production. Thus, although WNS may not have subjected the entire M. lucifugus population to selective pressure, it may have selected for specific alleles in Pennsylvania through decreased gene flow within the population.

With the unprecedented resolution of contemporary sequencing technologies, selection and migration can now be effectively quantified such that researchers can identify genetic elements involved in introgression. Furthermore, genomic patterns can now be associated with ecologically relevant phenotypes, given availability of annotated reference genomes. We do so in North American box turtles (Terrapene) by deciphering how selection affects hybrid zones at the interface of species boundaries and identifying genetic regions potentially under selection that may relate to thermal adaptations. Such genes may impact physiological pathways involved in temperature-dependent sex determination, immune system functioning and hypoxia tolerance. We contrasted these patterns across inter- and intraspecific hybrid zones that differ temporally and biogeographically. We demonstrate hybridization is broadly apparent inTerrapene, but with observed genomic cline patterns corresponding to species boundaries at loci potentially associated with thermal adaptation. These loci display signatures of directional introgression within intraspecific boundaries, despite a genome-wide selective trend against intergrades. In contrast, outlier loci for interspecific comparisons exhibited evidence of being under selection against hybrids.

We analyze 39 years of phenotypic data on horn size in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) subject to intense trophy hunting for 23 years, after which harvests nearly ceased. Our analyses revealed a significant decline in genetic value for horn length of rams, consistent with an evolutionary response to artificial selection on this trait. The probability that the observed change in male horn length was due solely to drift is 9.9%. Female horn length and male horn base, traits genetically correlated to the trait under selection, showed weak declining trends. There was no temporal trend in genetic value for female horn base circumference, a trait not directly targeted by selective hunting and not genetically correlated with male horn length. The decline in genetic value for male horn length stopped, but was not reversed, when hunting pressure was drastically reduced.

6133,NA,Fluctuating selection and its (elusive) evolutionary consequences in a wild rodent population,"Bonnet, T; Postma, E","Temporal fluctuations in the strength and direction of selection are often proposed as a mechanism that slows down evolution, both over geological and contemporary timescales. Both the prevalence of fluctuating selection and its relevance for evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood however, especially on contemporary timescales: unbiased empirical estimates of variation in selection are scarce, and the question of how much of the variation in selection translates into variation in genetic change has largely been ignored. Using long-term individual-based data for a wild rodent population, we quantify the magnitude of fluctuating selection on body size. Subsequently, we estimate the evolutionary dynamics of size and test for a link between fluctuating selection and evolution. We show that, over the past 11years, phenotypic selection on body size has fluctuated significantly. However, the strength and direction of genetic change have remained largely constant over the study period; that is, the rate of genetic change was similar in years where selection favoured heavier vs. lighter individuals. This result suggests that over shorter timescales, fluctuating selection does not necessarily translate into fluctuating evolution. Importantly however, individual-based simulations show that the correlation between fluctuating selection and fluctuating evolution can be obscured by the effect of drift, and that substantially more data are required for a precise and accurate estimate of this correlation.

Habitat-related adaptive divergence of these traits is therefore common among animals. We studied the genomic architecture of habitat-related divergence in the body shape of Gnathopogon fishes, a novel example of lake-stream ecomorphological divergence, and tested for the action of directional selection on body shape differentiation. Compared to stream-dwelling Gnathopogon elongatus, the sister species Gnathopogon caerulescens, exclusively inhabiting a large ancient lake, had an elongated body, increased proportion of the caudal region and small head, which would be advantageous in the limnetic environment. Using an F-2 interspecific cross between the two Gnathopogon species (195 individuals), quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with geometric morphometric quantification of body shape and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing-derived markers (1622 loci) identified 26 significant QTLs associated with the interspecific differences of body shape-related traits. These QTLs had small to moderate effects, supporting polygenic inheritance of the body shape-related traits. Each QTL was mostly located on different genomic regions, while colocalized QTLs were detected for some ecomorphologically relevant traits that are proxy of body and caudal peduncle depths, suggesting different degree of modularity among traits. The directions of the body shape QTLs were mostly consistent with the interspecific difference, and QTL sign test suggested a genetic signature of directional selection in the body shape divergence.

2670,NA,Niche shifting in response to warming climate after the last glacial maximum: inference from genetic data and niche assessments in the chisel-toothed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys microps),"Jezkova, T; Olah-Hemmings, V; Riddle, BR","During Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, the geographic range is often assumed to have shifted as a species tracks its climatic niche. Alternatively, the geographic range would not necessarily shift if a species can adapt in situ to a changing environment. The potential for a species to persist in place might increase with the diversity of habitat types that a species exploits. We evaluate evidence for either range shift or range stability between the last glacial maximum (LGM) and present time in the chisel-toothed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys microps), an endemic of the Great Basin and Mojave deserts. We modeled how the species' range would have changed if the climatic niche of the species remained conserved between the LGM and present time. The climatic models imply that if D. microps inhabited the same climatic niche during the LGM as it does today, the species would have persisted primarily within the warm Mojave Desert and expanded northwards into the cold Great Basin only after the LGM. Contrary to the climatic models, the mitochondrial DNA assessment revealed signals of population persistence within the current distribution of the species throughout at least the latest glacial-interglacial cycle. We concluded that D. microps did not track its climatic niche during late Pleistocene oscillations, but rather met the challenge of a changing environment by shifting its niche and retaining large portions of its distribution. We speculate that this kind of response to fluctuating climate was possible because of 'niche drifting', an alteration of the species' realized niche due to plasticity in various biological characters. Our study provides an example of an approach to reconstruct species' responses to past climatic changes that can be used to evaluate whether and to what extent taxa have capacity to shift their niches in response to the changing environment - information becoming increasingly important to predicting biotic responses to future environmental changes.",jezkovat@unlv.nevada.edu,2011,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02508.x,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,museum-dna,JW,KF,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No temporal sampling done- uses coalescent models to infer the past demographics

New double digest restriction-site associated DNA data presented here provide a robust framework to investigate the biogeographical history of and habitat transitions in Odontesthes. We show that Odontesthes silversides originally diversified in the Pacific but independently colonized the Atlantic three times, producing three independent marine-to-freshwater transitions. Our results also indicate recent introgression of marine mitochondrial haplotypes into two freshwater clades, with more recurring instances of hybridization among Atlantic- versus Pacific-slope species.

Despite competitive dominance, secondary colonization events by invading nonnative Vibrio fischeri have occurred. Competitive dominance can be offset through superior nonnative numbers and advantage of early start host colonization by nonnatives, granting nonnative vibrios an opportunity to establish beachheads in foreign Euprymna hosts. Here, we show that nonnative V. fischeri are capable of rapid adaptation to novel sepiolid squid hosts by serially passaging V. fischeri JRM200 (native to Hawaiian Euprymna scolopes) lines through the novel Australian squid host E. tasmanica for 500 generations.

However, most studies to date have overlooked the potential role of immigration of fish with different phenotypes as an alternative plausible mechanism behind observed phenotypic trends. Here, we investigated the evolutionary consequences of intensive fishing simultaneously at phenotypic and molecular level in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) population in the Baltic Sea over a 24-year period. We detected marked changes in size- and age-distributions and increase in juvenile growth rate. We also observed reduction of age at sexual maturity in males that has frequently been considered to support the hypothesis of fisheries-induced evolution. However, combined individual-based life-history and genetic analyses indicated increased immigration of foreign individuals with different life-history patterns as an alternative mechanism behind the observed phenotypic change.

One classical approach is to record frequency changes of heritable and visible genetic polymorphisms over multiple generations. Here, we combined this approach with a maximum likelihood-based population-genetic model with the aim of understanding and quantifying the evolutionary processes operating on a female mating polymorphism in the blue-tailed damselfly Ischnura elegans. Previous studies on this color-polymorphic species have suggested that males form a search image for females, which leads to excessive mating harassment of common female morphs. We analyzed a large temporally and spatially replicated data set of between-generation morph frequency changes in I. elegans. Morph frequencies were more stable than expected from genetic drift alone, suggesting the presence of selection toward a stable equilibrium that prevents local loss or fixation of morphs. This can be interpreted as the signature of negative frequency-dependent selection maintaining the phenotypic stasis and genetic diversity in these populations. Our novel analytical approach allows the estimation of the strength of frequency-dependent selection from the morph frequency fluctuations around their inferred long-term equilibria.

However, whether temporal isolation alone can act as the force initiating speciation and how often the same type of climatic disruption results in the divergence of allochronic populations in a lineage are largely unknown. The reproductive period of the winter geometrid moth Inurois punctigera is separated into early and late winter in habitats with severe winters, but not in habitats with mild winters, suggesting that the reproductive season is disrupted by the harshness of the mid-winter period. Here, we show that sympatric pairs of early- and late-winter populations that differ in origin exist in different regions, suggesting a parallel divergence of reproductive timing. In each region, significant genetic differentiation exists between these early- and late-winter populations, suggesting that the temporal reproductive isolation has persisted. Moreover, we demonstrate that the temporal isolation, in comparison with geographic isolation, contributes greatly to the genetic differentiation among geographic and temporal populations by an analysis of molecular variance and by a comparison of genetic differentiations (FST) between geographic populations with and without difference in reproductive season.

The process is one of the most controversial topics of the speciation debate, particularly in tropical regions. Here, we investigate ecologically based divergence across an Amazonian ecotone in the electric fish, Steatogenys elegans. We combine phylogenetics, genome scans, and population genetics with a recently developed individual-based evolutionary landscape genetics approach that incorporates selection. This framework is used to assess the relative contributions of geography and divergent natural selection between environments as biodiversity drivers. We report on two closely related and sympatric lineages that exemplify how divergent selection across a major Amazonian aquatic ecotone (i.e., between rivers with markedly different hydrochemical properties) may result in replicated ecologically mediated speciation. The results link selection across an ecological gradient with reproductive isolation and we propose that assortative mating based on water color may be driving the divergence. Divergence resulting from ecologically driven selection highlights the importance of considering environmental heterogeneity in studies of speciation in tropical regions.

Although guppy populations in Trinidad have been a model for studies of evolutionary ecology and sexual selection for more than 50 years, this work has been conducted with little understanding of the phylogenetic history of this species. We used variation in nuclear (X-src) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to examine the phylogeographic history of Poecilia reticulata Peters (the guppy) across its entire natural range, and to test whether patterns of morphological divergence are a consequence of parallel evolution. Phylogenetic, nested clade, population genetic, and demographic analyses were conducted to investigate patterns of genetic structure at several temporal scales and are discussed in relation to vicariant events, such as tectonic activity and glacial cycles, shaping northeast South American river drainages. The mtDNA phylogeny defined five major lineages, each associated with one or more river drainages, and analysis of molecular variance also detected geographic structuring among these river drainages in an evolutionarily conserved nuclear (X-src) locus. Nested clade and other demographic analyses suggest that the eastern Venezuela/ western Trinidad region is likely the center of origin of P. reticulata. Mantel tests show that the divergence of morphological characters, known to differentiate on a local scale in response to natural and sexual selection pressures, is not associated with mtDNA genetic distance; however, TreeScan analysis identified several significant associations of these characters with the haplotype tree. Parallel upstream/downstream patterns of morphological adaptation in response to selection pressures reported in P. reticulata within Trinidad rivers appears to persist across the natural range.

Estimates of male I and I-s differed significantly from those of females when estimated with four different methods and only males had a significant Bateman gradient.

For marine fish with high dispersal capabilities, this remains a fundamental challenge. Based on daily parentage assignments of more than 4,000 offspring, we document fine-scaled temporal differences in individual reproductive success for two spatially adjacent (<10 km) populations of a broadcast-spawning marine fish. Distinguished by differences in genetics and life history, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) from inner- and outer-fjord populations were allowed to compete for mating and reproductive opportunities. After accounting for phenotypic variability in several traits, reproductive success of outer-fjord cod was significantly lower than that of inner-fjord cod. This finding, given that genomically different cod ecotypes inhabit inner- and outer-fjord waters, raises the intriguing hypothesis that the populations might be diverging because of ecological speciation. Individual reproductive success, skewed within both sexes (more so among males), was positively affected by body size, which also influenced the timing of reproduction, larger individuals spawning later among females but earlier among males.

The 'kinship hypothesis' posits that such cycles are caused by changes in kin structure among territorial males producing delayed density-dependent changes in aggressiveness, which in turn influence recruitment and regulate density. The kinship hypothesis makes several specific predictions about the levels of kinship, aggressiveness and recruitment through a population cycle: (i) kin structure will build up during the increase phase of a cycle, but break down prior to peak density; (ii) kin structure influences aggressiveness, such that there will be a negative relationship between kinship and aggressiveness over the years; (iii) as aggressiveness regulates recruitment and density, there will be a negative relationship between aggressiveness in one year and both recruitment and density in the next; (iv) as kin structure influences recruitment via an affect on aggressiveness, there will be a positive relationship between kinship in one year and recruitment the next.

Several explanations have been proposed for chaotic genetic patchiness, including sweepstakes reproductive success, variability in larval source, and natural selection. In a survey of the green shore crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis in Bodega Bay, California, USA, allele frequencies at a mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphism were found to differ significantly among samples of first-stage zoeae and between zoeae and adults. Sweepstakes reproductive success is unlikely to be responsible because the fecundity of this species is too low and there was no reduction in genetic diversity among zoeae. In principle, influxes of larvae from genetically distinct populations over 500 km to the north could have caused these differences; however, coalescent estimates indicated that gene flow from these distant populations has been very low and it is unlikely that first-stage zoeae would have been transported such great distances. The possibility remains that natural selection, directly or indirectly, is responsible for the observed patchiness in mitochondrial allele frequencies.",bhcornwell@ucdavis.edu,2016,10.3354/meps11628,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,temporal-genetics,EG,KF,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"More of a species identification focus, no temporal comparison between the same life stage- larvae collected in 2006 and adults collected in 2010"
3325,NA,mtDNA haplotypes differ in their probability of being eliminated by a mass die-off in an abundant seabird,"Drovetski, SV; Kitaysky, AS; Mode, NA; Zink, RM; Iqbal, U; Barger, C","In this study, we take advantage of a natural experiment a 2004 mass die-off of the Common Murre in Alaska to determine whether closely related mtDNA haplotypes differ in their probability of being eliminated during such a short term but a marked event removing hundreds of thousands of individuals. We sequenced complete mtDNA ND2 gene 11041 bp) for 168 Common Murres sampled from seven breeding colonies across Alaska before the 2004 die-off and 127 dead murres washed ashore during the die-off. We found little mtDNA variation and lack of geographical structuring among the seven Common Murre breeding colonies in Alaska. A comparison of the single-dominant mtDNA haplotype's frequency between live murres sampled on breeding colonies before the die-off (73.2%; 95% confidence interval 66.3-79.9%) and dead murres sampled during the die-off (59.1%; 95% confidence interval 50.4-67.4%; Fisher's exact P=0.01) showed that carriers of the dominant haplotype were significantly less likely to die than carriers of other haplotypes. At the same time, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions did not differ between live (10:35) and dead birds (18:34; Fisher's exact P=0.26), indicating that non-synonymous substitutions were as likely to be eliminated as synonymous substitutions. These results are consistent with the possibility of positive selection on the dominant mtDNA haplotype during the die-off.

191,NA,High genomic diversity and candidate genes under selection associated with range expansion in eastern coyote (Canis latrans) populations,"Heppenheimer, E; Brzeski, KE; Hinton, JW; Patterson, BR; Rutledge, LY; DeCandia, AL; Wheeldon, T; Fain, SR; Hohenlohe, PA; Kays, R; White, BN; Chamberlain, MJ; vonHoldt, BM","Range expansion is a widespread biological process, with well-described theoretical expectations associated with the colonization of novel ranges. However, comparatively few empirical studies address the genomic outcomes accompanying the genome-wide consequences associated with the range expansion process, particularly in recent or ongoing expansions. Here, we assess two recent and distinct eastward expansion fronts of a highly mobile carnivore, the coyote (Canis latrans), to investigate patterns of genomic diversity and identify variants that may have been under selection during range expansion. Using a restriction-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), we genotyped 394 coyotes at 22,935 SNPs and found that overall population structure corresponded to their 19th century historical range and two distinct populations that expanded during the 20th century. Counter to theoretical expectations for populations to bottleneck during range expansions, we observed minimal evidence for decreased genomic diversity across coyotes sampled along either expansion front, which is likely due to hybridization with other Canis species. Furthermore, we identified 12 SNPs, located either within genes or putative regulatory regions, that were consistently associated with range expansion. Of these 12 genes, three (CACNA1C, ALK, and EPHA6) have putative functions related to dispersal, including habituation to novel environments and spatial learning, consistent with the expectations for traits under selection during range expansion. Although coyote colonization of eastern North America is well-publicized, this study provides novel insights by identifying genes associated with dispersal capabilities in coyotes on the two eastern expansion fronts.",eh7@princeton.edu,2018,10.1002/ece3.4688,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,RC,ACS,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RC: moved to adaptation bc talks mostly about selection.

7962,NA,Candidate gene variation in gilthead sea bream reveals complex spatiotemporal selection patterns between marine and lagoon habitats,"Guinand, B; Chauvel, C; Lechene, M; Tournois, J; Tsigenopoulos, CS; Darnaude, AM; McKenzie, DJ; Gagnaire, PA","In marine fishes, the extent to which spatial patterns induced by selection remain stable across generations remains largely unknown. In the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata, polymorphisms in the growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (Prl) genes can display high levels of differentiation between marine and lagoon habitats. These genotype-environment associations have been attributed to differential selection following larval settlement, but it remains unclear whether selective mortality during later juvenile stages further shapes genetic differences among habitats. We addressed this question by analysing differentiation patterns at GH and Prl markers together with a set of 21 putatively neutral microsatellite loci. We compared genetic variation of spring juveniles that had just settled in 3 ecologically different lagoons against older juveniles sampled from the same sites in autumn, at the onset of winter outmigration. In spring, genetic differentiation among lagoons was greater than expected from neutrality for both candidate gene markers. Surprisingly, this signal disappeared completely in the older juveniles, with no significant differentiation for either locus a few months later in autumn. We searched for signals of haplotype structure within GH and Prl genes using next-generation amplicon deep sequencing. Both genes contained 2 groups of haplotypes, but high similarities among groups indicated that signatures of selection, if any, had largely been erased by recombination. Our results are consistent with the view that differential selection operates during early juvenile life in sea bream and highlight the importance of temporal replication in studies of post-settlement selection in marine fish.",bruno.guinand@umontpellier.fr,2016,10.3354/meps11851,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,temporal-genetics,JW,KF,reject,non-temporal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RC: moved to adaptation bc mostly interested in signatures of selection at diff life history stages KF: reject, non-temporal because there were no comparisons done across years"
2987,NA,Rapid genome-wide evolution in Brassica rapa populations following drought revealed by sequencing of ancestral and descendant gene pools,"Franks, SJ; Kane, NC; O'Hara, NB; Tittes, S; Rest, JS","There is increasing evidence that evolution can occur rapidly in response to selection. Recent advances in sequencing suggest the possibility of documenting genetic changes as they occur in populations, thus uncovering the genetic basis of evolution, particularly if samples are available from both before and after selection. Here, we had a unique opportunity to directly assess genetic changes in natural populations following an evolutionary response to a fluctuation in climate. We analysed genome-wide differences between ancestors and descendants of natural populations of Brassica rapa plants from two locations that rapidly evolved changes in multiple phenotypic traits, including flowering time, following a multiyear late-season drought in California. These ancestor-descendant comparisons revealed evolutionary shifts in allele frequencies in many genes. Some genes showing evolutionary shifts have functions related to drought stress and flowering time, consistent with an adaptive response to selection. Loci differentiated between ancestors and descendants (F-ST outliers) were generally different from those showing signatures of selection based on site frequency spectrum analysis (Tajima's D), indicating that the loci that evolved in response to the recent drought and those under historical selection were generally distinct. Very few genes showed similar evolutionary responses between two geographically distinct populations, suggesting independent genetic trajectories of evolution yielding parallel phenotypic changes. The results show that selection can result in rapid genome-wide evolutionary shifts in allele frequencies in natural populations, and highlight the usefulness of combining resurrection experiments in natural populations with genomics for studying the genetic basis of adaptive evolution. see also the Perspective by Hancock",franks@fordham.edu,2016,10.1111/mec.13615,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,KJ,KF,reject,non-animal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,KF: reject because the study species is a type of plant
3842,NA,A spatial and temporal approach to microevolutionary forces affecting population biology in the freshwater snail Biomphalaria pfeifferi,"Charbonnel, N; Quesnoit, M; Razatavonjizay, R; Bremond, P; Jarne, P","The limitations of both population demography and genetics highlight the need to combine these approaches when inferring the influence of demographic processes and modes of migration on genetic structure. The aim of this study was to use spatiotemporal genetic and demographic surveys to reveal the microevolutionary forces acting on the metapopulation dynamics of the freshwater snail Biomphalaria pfeifferi. We also analyzed the consequences of population turnover on temporal genetic differentiation, an aspect that has been little explored. Genetic drift was revealed by both the demographic survey, which indicated severe bottlenecks or extinction during the rainy (resp. dry) season in open (resp. closed) habitats, and the genetic approach, which indicated high selfing rates and strong temporal differentiation. Genetic reassignments and temporal differentiation both confirmed the results of the demographic survey, which suggests that migration occurs in closed (resp. open) habitats during the hot and dry (resp. rainy) season, and indicated that source-sink functioning may be envisaged. A propagule pool mode of colonization was inferred in the open habitats during the rainy season and a migrant pool in the closed habitats during the dry season.

6839,NA,Temporal correlation of population composition and environmental variables in the marine invader Ciona robusta,"Caputi, L; Toscano, F; Arienzo, M; Ferrara, L; Procaccini, G; Sordino, P","The capacity for ascidians to inhabit coastal sea floor worldwide relies on their peculiar tolerance to environmental variables and pollution, which is considered, together with high levels of genetic diversity, among the main drivers of their invasive potential. In spite of the continued interest in the genetics of invasive species, little attention has been paid toward the microevolutionary processes that drive structure and fate of ascidian populations over time under chemically polluted conditions. Understanding the interplay between environmental and population dynamics is critical to predict the biodiversity of marine coastal ecosystems. In the present study, a local population of the ascidian Ciona robusta living in the Fusaro Lagoon has been monitored over a 13-month period of sampling. Physico-chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, heavy metals), genetic composition (microsatellites, ITS-2), abundance and biomass (wet and dry weight) were assessed with the aim to infer fine-scale temporal variation of population structure with respect to rapid environmental change. Analysis of biomass showed that C. robusta is highly sensitive to salinity and oxygen concentrations. Further, genetic analysis suggested a highly dynamic population structure, likely due to the strong clustering of temporal samples and distinct responses to environmental conditions, including bio-accumulation of heavy metals. Here, we hypothesize that rapid variation in allele frequencies of neutral markers in C. robusta populations may increase the ability of the species to colonize habitats that are subject to strong variation and are under heavy human pressure.",caputi@szn.it; paoio.sordino@szn.it,2019,10.1111/maec.12543,MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE,temporal-genetics,KJ,KF,accept,accept,empirical,adaptation,NA,NA,NA,no,marine,Acidiacea,Italy,FusaroLagoon,"2012.06.01, 2012.05.01, 2012.04.01, 2012.03.01, 2012.02.01, 2011.12.01, 2011.11.01, 2011.10.01, 2011.09.01, 2011.08.01, 2011.07.01, 2011.06.01, 2011.05.01",99.54.25.112.87.48.104.23.23.47.34.43.70,13,2011.05.01,2012.06.01,90,pre-designed,anthropogenic,env_variation,NA,NA,acute,microsat,NA,"ethanol, frozen",NA,NA,PCR,"Total number of samples reported for 3 locations, not sure this paper is looking at adaptation"

In lakes on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (off western Canada), stickleback have undergone a remarkable local radiation and show phenotypic diversity matching that seen throughout the species distribution. To provide a historical context for this radiation, we surveyed genetic variation at >1000single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in stickleback from over 100 populations. SNPs included markers evenly distributed throughout genome and candidate SNPs tagging adaptive genomic regions. Based on evenly distributed SNPs, the phylogeographic pattern differs substantially from the disjunct pattern previously observed between two highly divergent mtDNA lineages. The SNP tree instead shows extensive within watershed population clustering and different watersheds separated by short branches deep in the tree. These data are consistent with separate colonizations of most watersheds, despite underlying genetic connections between some independent drainages. This supports previous suppositions that morphological diversity observed between watersheds has been shaped independently, with populations exhibiting complete loss of lateral plates and giant size each occurring in several distinct clades. Throughout the archipelago, we see repeated selection of SNPs tagging candidate freshwater adaptive variants at several genomic regions differentiated between marinefreshwater populations on a global scale (e.g. EDA, Na/K ATPase). In estuarine sites, both marine and freshwater allelic variants were commonly detected. We also found typically marine alleles present in a few freshwater lakes, especially those with completely plated morphology.
