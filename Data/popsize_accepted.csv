2418,,Noninvasive Sampling Reveals Short-Term Genetic Rescue in an Insular Red Fox Population,"Quinn, CB; Alden, PB; Sacks, BN","Genetic factors in the decline of small populations are extremely difficult to study in nature. We leveraged a natural experiment to investigate evidence of inbreeding depression and genetic rescue in a remnant population of subalpine-specialized Sierra Nevada red foxes (Vulpes vulpes necator) using noninvasive genetic monitoring during 2010-2017. Only 7 individuals were detected in the first 2 years. These individuals assigned genetically to the historical population and exhibited genetic hallmarks of inbreeding and no evidence of reproduction. Two years into the study, we detected 2 first-generation immigrant males from a recently expanding population of red foxes in the Great Basin Desert. Through annual resampling of individuals (634 red fox DNA samples, 41 individuals) and molecular reconstruction of pedigrees, we documented 1-3 litters/year for 5 years, all descended directly or indirectly from matings involving immigrant foxes. The observed heterozygosity and allelic richness of the population nearly doubled in 2 years. Abundance increased, indicative of a rapidly expanding population. Throughout the study, adult survival was high. Restoration of gene flow apparently improved the demographic trajectory of this population in the short term. Whether these benefits continue in the longer term could depend on numerous factors, such as maintenance of any locally adapted alleles.

680,,Population dynamics and genetic differentiation in the bivalve mollusc Abra tenuis: aplanic dispersal,"Holmes, SP; Dekker, R; Williams, ID","The bivalve mollusc Abra tenuis is an aplanic (directly developing) Species occupying a discontinuous (fragmented) habitat in the high intertidal area of mudflats. In view of its mode of reproduction and habitat, populations of A. tenuis should exhibit temporal stability and be genetically dissimilar. Examination of the population dynamics of A. tenuis, at 2 sites in the Dutch Western Wadden Sea over the last 29 yr, has revealed that population densities fluctuate wildly from year to year, and that there have been 2 'apparent' local extinction events, one of which lasted for 3 yr. Investigation into the population genetics of Abra tenuis in the Dutch Western Wadden Sea, using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, both at the macro (greater than or equal to2 km) and microscale (greater than or equal to30 m), determined that 6 of the 7 studied populations formed 3 groups that were genetically homogenous within a group, but genetically distinct from each other. This included a group pair where the distance of geographical separation was similar to3 km. The 7th population was genetically distinct from all other population groups. While there is some degree of genetic differentiation among populations, given both the population genetics and dynamics results, it is evident that dispersal has occurred among some Populations.",holmes@nioz.nl,2004,10.3354/meps268131,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,temporal-genetics,EG,Kyle,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Only uses genetic RAPD data from one sampling point (2002),,,,,,,,,,
1932,,Trends of the genetic effective population size in the Southern stock of the European hake,"Pita, A; Perez, M; Velasco, F; Presa, P","Scarce evidence exists on the amount of genetic diversity remaining after fishing overharvest, on how the genetic effective population size (Ne) behaves under counteracting forces such as drift and migration, and on Pie predictability of population status and trends. This study aims testing both, the temporal stability of the genetic diversity among samples from the Southern stock of European hake and the influence of a high fishing intensity on its Ne. Such goals were addressed with variation of microsatellites and Cytochrome b haplotypes on an 82 sample collection taken in years of deep population depletion (2000-2007) plus a historical anchoring sample from 1976 which predates the industrial exploitation of this fishery. Despite the Southern stock exhibits similar levels of variation at microsatellites and Cytochrome b across the historical window addressed, Ne experienced a 43-fold reduction in parallel to an 80% biomass (N-ssb) loss between the historical estimates of 1976 (N-ssb =20.55*10(6) Mi, N-e = 12,480) and their minimums of 2004 (N-ssb = 4.68*10(6) Mi, N-e = 291). Neither Ne nor N-e/N-ssb matched SSB trends at overharvest in 2000-2007, when a faster Ne reduction was patent. Nevertheless, Ne correlated well with SSB and the N-e/N-ssb ratio was maximal at population equilibrium and minimal at population depletion. Current results suggest that the short-term unpredictability of Ne on population trends following overexploitation can be circumvented by increasing the number of point estimates from pre-harvest and postharvest times. We show that the Southern stock has passed through a genetic throat of N-e approximate to 300 between 2002 and 2005 upon which biomass rebounded to 1/3 in 2007 and to1/2 in 2014 of its N-e size from equilibrium in 1976. Such recovery was likely helped by EU policies enforced to make this fishery sustainable, but collateral enhancers such as maintenance of a minimum Ne threshold and the enriching input of occasional gene flow from the Northern stock of hake, have presumably played a synergic role at triggering overfishing resilience. Incorporating both, structural genetics and genetic metrics such as Ne into assessment can provide more precision on the rate of genetic erosion and improving assessing risks of extinction by genetic factors.

Evolutionary phenomena, such as cryptic speciation and modification due to the environment, hamper reliable conclusions about the distribution of this important plankton group. We combined newly collected samples from the Black Sea (ten new strains from three localities) with occurrence data, which have been gathered extensively over the past decade, in order to provide the first global distribution maps of four specific ribotypes assigned to the Scrippsiella lineage (Thoracosphaeraceae, Peridiniales) collected at a total of 39 sites. They showed a wide, partly overlapping distribution and shared the presence primarily at the coastal localities. Differences in abundance of specific ribotypes were observed, but the ribotype corresponding to the globally most frequently encountered species Scrippsiella acuminata has not yet been found in the Black Sea. We discuss the significance of DNA-based records for distribution maps particularly of unicellular organisms such as dinophytes. Based on a collective approach as exemplified in our study, we may start to understand in detail the ecological basis and the dynamics of the individual colonisation/invasion events, species establishment and consequent distribution in the microbiome, all of which have been changing drastically due to the ongoing climate change.",gottschling@bio.lmu.de,2019,10.1007/s12526-018-0848-y,MARINE BIODIVERSITY,historical-dna,KC,Kyle,reject,non-animal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed mitochondrial DNA variation using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome-b (cyt-b ) gene and control region, and we found two distinct clades consistent with the morphological designation of the two species. The sequence divergence between the two clades was 0.0484 substitutions per site for cyt-b and 0.0396 for the control region, suggesting that divergence of the two clades occurred during the middle to late Pleistocene. We also examined the historical demography of the two clades using stepwise and exponential expansion models, both of which indicated recent rapid population growth. Furthermore, using the program migrate we found evidence of migration from populations north of the Fraser River (British Columbia) to the south in both clades.

2091,,Impact of historical founder effects and a recent bottleneck on MHC variability in Commander Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus),"Ploshnitsa, AI; Goltsman, ME; Macdonald, DW; Kennedy, LJ; Sommer, S","Populations of Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) have been isolated on two of the Commander Islands (Bering and Mednyi) from the circumpolar distributed mainland population since the Pleistocene. In 1970-1980, an epizootic outbreak of mange caused a severe population decline on Mednyi Island. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a primary role in infectious disease resistance. The main objectives of our study were to compare contemporary variation of MHC class II in mainland and island Arctic foxes, and to document the effects of the isolation and the recent bottleneck on MHC polymorphism by analyzing samples from historical and contemporary Arctic foxes. In 184 individuals, we found 25 unique MHC class II DRB and DQB alleles, and identified evidence of balancing selection maintaining allelic lineages over time at both loci. Twenty different MHC alleles were observed in mainland foxes and eight in Bering Island foxes. The historical Mednyi population contained five alleles and all contemporary individuals were monomorphic at both DRB and DQB. Our data indicate that despite positive and diversifying selection leading to elevated rates of amino acid replacement in functionally important antigen-binding sites, below a certain population size, balancing selection may not be strong enough to maintain genetic diversity in functionally important genes.

7251,,Evaluating effective population size and genetic diversity of a declining kit fox population using contemporary and historical specimens,"Lonsinger, RC; Adams, JR; Waits, LP","Loss of genetic diversity has serious conservation consequences (e.g., loss of adaptive potential, reduced population viability), but is difficult to evaluate without developing long-term, multigenerational datasets. Alternatively, historical samples can provide insights into changes in genetic diversity and effective population size (N-e). Kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) are a species of conservation concern across much of their range. In western Utah, kit fox abundance has declined precipitously from historical levels, causing concern about population persistence. We analyzed genetic samples from museum specimens and contemporary scats to evaluate temporal changes in (a) genetic diversity and (b) N-e for kit foxes in western Utah, and (c) discuss our findings with respect to population risk and conservation. The N-e of kit foxes in western Utah has decreased substantially. When compared to established conservation thresholds for N-e (e.g., the 50/500 rule), observed levels suggest the population may be at risk of inbreeding depression and local extinction. In contrast, we found no significant decrease in genetic diversity associated with declining N-e. We detected evidence of low levels of immigration into the population and suspect genetic diversity may have been maintained by this previously undescribed gene flow from adjacent populations. Low or intermittent immigration may serve to temper the potential short-term negative consequences of low N-e. We recommend that kit fox conservation efforts focus on evaluating and maintaining landscape connectivity. We demonstrate how historical specimens can provide a baseline of comparison for contemporary populations, highlighting the importance of natural history collections to conservation during a period of declining funding and support.",Robert.Lonsinger@sdstate.edu,2018,10.1002/ece3.4660,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,JW,Brendan,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,diversity,connectivity,,no,terrestrial,Mammalia,USA,Utah,"2014.01.01, 1955.01.01","76,49",1241,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,competition,,chronic,microsat,bone,dried,Silica,Sanger,PCR,,,,,,,,,,,
871,,"Spatial and temporal patterns of genetic diversity in an endangered Hawaiian honeycreeper, the Hawaii Akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus)","Reding, DM; Freed, LA; Cann, RL; Fleischer, RC","As a result of disease, habitat destruction, and other anthropogenic factors, the Hawaii Akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus) currently occupies <10% of its original range and exists in five disjunct populations, raising concerns about what effect such reduction and fragmentation has had on the connectivity and diversity of Akepa populations. In this study, we used both historical and contemporary samples to assess genetic diversity and structure in this endangered Hawaiian honeycreeper. We generated sequence data from two mtDNA regions (ND2, control region) and two nuclear introns for contemporary samples representing three of the five current populations. We also generated control region sequence data for museum specimens collected over 100 years ago from throughout the historical range of the bird. Results indicate that despite recent declines and fragmentation, genetic diversity has not been lost. We detected a modest level of genetic differentiation, which followed a combined pattern of isolation-by-barriers and isolation-by-distance, across the historical range of Akepa. The similarly low level of differentiation observed between the contemporary populations indicates that not much divergence, if any, has occurred post-fragmentation. Rather, the present structure seen likely reflects the historical pattern of distribution. Ironically, this declining species exhibits the genetic signal of an expanding population, demonstrating that earlier demographic events are outweighing the effects of recent changes in population size, and genetic estimates of Ne, though crude, suggest Hawaii Akepa were at least an order of magnitude more abundant prior to the decline.",reding@iastate.edu,2010,10.1007/s10592-009-0025-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,AAS,Brendan,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,diversity,,,no,terrestrial,Aves,USA,Hawaii,"2006.01.01,2002.01.01,2000.01.01,1995.01.01,1988.01.01,1903.01.01,1902.01.01,1901.01.01,1900.01.01,1899.01.01,1898.01.01,1896.01.01,1895.01.01,1894.01.01,1892.01.01,1891.01.01,1888.01.01","15,24,4,1,3,1,5,1,3,1,5,2,1,2,6,15,2",1095,opportunistic,anthropogenic,disease,habitat_loss,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,skin,dried,Phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,Also nuclear seqs but only for contemporary individuals.

For species that have specific habitat requirements, habitat loss can result in substantial genetic effects, potentially impeding future adaptability and evolution. The endangered black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) suffered a substantial contraction of breeding habitat and population size during much of the 20th century. In a previous study, we reported significant differentiation between remnant populations, but failed to recover a strong genetic signal of bottlenecks. In this study, we used a combination of historical and contemporary sampling from Oklahoma and Texas to (i) determine whether population structure and genetic diversity have changed over time and (ii) evaluate alternate demographic hypotheses using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We found lower genetic diversity and increased differentiation in contemporary samples compared to historical samples, indicating nontrivial impacts of fragmentation. ABC analysis suggests a bottleneck having occurred in the early part of the 20th century, resulting in a magnitude decline in effective population size.

Genetic techniques may help to distinguish populations that are self-sustaining from those at risk of further decline, and demographic interdependence among subpopulations. We tested the use of genetic data for identifying stable and self-sustaining abalone populations, as well as the efficacy of a restoration technique for use in those populations that are not. We created an artificial aggregation of wild adult pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata) in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA. We genetically analyzed those individuals and additional adults and juveniles in the broader region. A self-sustained population should not be demographically reliant upon immigration. Temporal variability in relatedness among juvenile cohorts, and a lack of fine-scale spatial structure in adult and juvenile relatedness indicated complex recruitment dynamics and/or long distance larval delivery. We estimated a low effective population size (N-e = 188) and a very low ratio of effective population to census population size (N-e/N = 2.0 x 10(-3)). These data are consistent with sweepstakes reproductive success, and suggest that the population is at risk of genetic diversity decline. Parentage assignment revealed that none of the juveniles sampled one year after aggregating adults had parents from this aggregation. Collectively, our results suggest that restoration efforts will need to achieve a greater density (0.18 m(-2)) and/or number of individuals (46) to improve local recruitment. Our results also suggest that the Point Loma kelp forest population of pink abalone is of insufficient density for long-term viability, may be reliant upon immigration, and cannot be defined as an independent """"local"""" population unit.

Population genetics provide a genuine alternative to estimate population size and inbreeding using non-lethal procedures. The long-snouted seahorse, Hippocampus guttulatus, is facing multiple threats such as human disturbance or by-catch, and has been listed in the red list of IUCN. One large population is found in the Thau lagoon, in the south of France. A recent study has shown this population belongs to a genetic lineage only found in Mediterranean lagoons that can be considered as an Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) and should be managed with dedicated conservation strategies. In the present study, we used genetic analysis of temporal samples to estimate the effective population size of the Thau population and correlations between individual multilocus heterozygosity and fitness traits to investigate the possible expression of inbreeding depression in the wild. Non-invasive sampling of 172 seahorses for which profiles were pictured and biometric data recorded were genotyped using 291 informative SNPs. Genetic diversity remained stable over a 7-year time interval. In addition, very low levels of close relatedness and inbreeding were observed, with only a single pair of related individuals in 2008 and two inbreds in 2013. We did not detect departure from identity equilibrium. The effective population size was estimated to be N-e = 2742 ( 40 reproductive seahorses per km(2)), larger than previously thought. No correlation was observed between heterozygosity and fluctuating asymmetry or other morphometric traits, suggesting a population with low variance in inbreeding. Together these results suggest this population does not meet conventional genetic criteria of an endangered population, as the population seems sufficiently large to avoid inbreeding and its detrimental effects.

6053,,Phenotypic changes and reduced genetic diversity have accompanied the rapid decline of the garden tiger moth (Arctia caja) in the UK,"Anderson, SJ; Conrad, KF; Gillman, MP; Woiwod, IP; Freeland, JR","1. Previous studies have quantified the recent decline of numerous Lepidopteran species in the U.K., including the garden tiger moth (Arctia caja), in C which abundance has decreased by 85% over the past 30 years. At the same time that overall numbers have been falling, the distribution of abundance of this species has been moving northwards. In this study, morphological and genetic data were used to C, investigate the possibility that these changes in abundance and distribution have been accompanied by microevolutionary changes. 2. A comparison of wing size and shape in current and historical moth samples revealed that wing shape has altered significantly over the past century, resulting in longer, narrower hindwings and narrower forewings for a given forewing length. Habitat fragmentation and increased suitability of northerly sites provide a plausible explanation for the selection of increasingly dispersive individuals. 3. Mitochondrial DNA revealed no phylogeographic structuring either before or after the population decline. However, a comparison of mtDNA haplotypes from current and museum specimens indicated that the recent population decline across the U.K. has been accompanied by a significant loss of genetic diversity. 4.

Samples obtained from 1892 to 2003 were subdivided into historical (prior to 1970) and recent (from 1970) groups. As compared with the historical samples, there was a significant loss of genetic variation in the recent Jutland population, but not in Sealand. Effective population sizes were estimated using Bayesian-based software (TMVP). Historical effective population sizes were 5897 (90% highest probability density, HPD, limits: 1502-6849) in Jutland and 1300 (90% HPD limits: 224-5929) in Sealand, whereas recent effective population sizes were 14.7 (90% HPD limits: 10.9-23.5) in Jutland and 802 (90% HPD limits: 51.8-5510) in Sealand. Significant genetic differentiation (F-ST) was found between the two historical samples, between the two recent samples, and between the historical and the recent sample in Jutland; whereas the F-ST value between the historical and the recent sample in Sealand was not significant. The significant genetic differentiation between the historical and the recent samples indicates changes in the genetic compositions over time, and the higher F-ST values between the two recent samples, as compared with the two historical samples, indicates that the populations in Sealand and Jutland have drifted apart within a short time span.

We also compare the performance of different methods to test for historic bottlenecks and infer past demography based on genetic data. We found substantially higher levels of genetic diversity in gray than in humpback whales (for both time periods), likely due to recent connectivity between Atlantic and Pacific gray whale populations. Other than mitochondrial diversity in humpback whales, levels of diversity were not lower in contemporary samples relative to prewhaling samples, indicating that commercial whaling had a minimal impact on metrics of genetic diversity themselves.

We assessed the molecular biogeography of the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) through mitogenome and cytochrome b + control region sequencing of 89 historical and modern samples to (1) establish a time-calibrated phylogeography across the species' native range and (2) test introduction scenarios to western Indian Ocean islands. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses identified 3 geographic lineages (East Asia, sister-group to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent + northern Indochina) diverging 3.2-2.3 million years ago (Mya), with no clear signature of past demographic expansion. Within Southeast Asia, Balinese populations separated from the rest 2.6-1.3 Mya. Western Indian Ocean populations were assigned to the Indian subcontinent + northern Indochina lineage and had the lowest mitochondrial diversity. Approximate Bayesian computation did not distinguish between single versus multiple introduction scenarios. The early diversification of the small Indian civet was likely shaped by humid periods in the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene that created evergreen rainforest barriers, generating areas of intra-specific endemism in the Indian subcontinent, East, and Southeast Asia. Later, Pleistocene dispersals through drier conditions in South and Southeast Asia were likely, giving rise to the species' current natural distribution.

The results of this comparison confirmed differences between dormant and pelagic samples. Specifically, D. galeata was overrepresented in the sedimentary egg bank in comparison to the pelagic population, indicating that this taxon is more involved in sexual reproduction than other taxa. In addition to being successfully applied on formaldehyde-preserved samples, SNP-genotyping was more efficient than microsatellites on sedimentary eggs, and was more sensitive for hybrid detection.

8877,,Spatial and temporal variation in genetic diversity of an endangered freshwater seal,"Valtonen, M; Palo, JU; Ruokonen, M; Kunnasranta, M; Nyman, T","Molecular-genetic assessments of demographic history, population structure, and loss of genetic variation in small natural populations are often hampered by a lack of information on initial diversity, isolation time, and migration rates. The landlocked population of currently less than 300 ringed seals inhabiting Lake Saimaa in southeastern Finland offers a unique model for studying these questions in small populations. It has remained completely isolated since the last ice age, information on its initial genetic diversity can be inferred from the large marine source population in the Baltic Sea, and its ecology is well studied. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA diversity of 215 Saimaa ringed seals spanning three decades in order to assess long- and short-term changes in the gene pool of this critically endangered subspecies. The mtDNA diversity of the Saimaa ringed seal is low, consisting of only eight haplotypes. Nevertheless, coalescent simulations show that the diversity is unexpectedly high when contrasted with the over 800 generations of isolation and the estimated historical carrying capacity of the lake. In the short term, marked temporal and spatial differentiation was observed among three decades and four regions of Lake Saimaa, suggesting extremely low effective subpopulation sizes and limited migration of females within the lake. Our study strongly suggests that enhancing gene flow and population growth is crucial for maintaining the remaining genetic diversity of the Saimaa ringed seal.",mia.valtonen@uef.fi,2012,10.1007/s10592-012-0367-5,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,KF,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper should be in the diversity section, no analysis of population size metrics; 1-700bp mitochondrial region",,,,,,,,,,

Its populations have become fragmented and undergone major declines in recent decades. To study genetic differences between populations across the range and change in genetic diversity over time, we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 67 museum specimens (years 1861-1976) as well as 39 contemporary samples from Spain and seven from Greece (years 1992-2003). In the historical sample, we found a lack of significant genetic structure between populations in different areas. We found evidence that the species experienced a rapid expansion in the past, perhaps from glacial refugia centred around the Mediterranean following the last ice age. In Spain, the population went through a dramatic bottleneck in the 1970s and early 1980s, when only a few dozens individuals remained in the wild. Although population size has since recovered to a few thousand individuals, we found a highly significant loss of mitochondrial haplotype diversity between the historical and contemporary samples. Given ongoing declines in other areas, losses in genetic diversity that may reduce the adaptive potential of white-headed ducks in the future are a continuing concern throughout the geographic range of this species.",v_munoz@ebd.csic.es,2005,10.1007/s10592-005-9093-6,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,KF,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,popsize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper should be in the diversity section, only historical sampling included were in diversity analyses; historical samples had 200bp mito region, contemp had 500bp mito region",,,,,,,,,,

Many species of marine mammals have experienced dramatic changes in abundance and distribution due to climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic impacts. However, thanks to conservation efforts, some of these species have shown remarkable population recovery and are now recolonizing their former ranges. Here, we use zooarchaeological, demographic and genetic data to examine processes of colonization, local extinction and recolonization of the two northern European grey seal subspecies inhabiting the Baltic Sea and North Sea. The zooarchaeological and genetic data suggest that the two subspecies diverged shortly after the formation of the Baltic Sea approximately 4200 years BP, probably through a gradual shift to different breeding habitats and phenologies. By comparing genetic data from 19th century pre-extinction material with that from seals currently recolonizing their past range, we observed a marked spatiotemporal shift in subspecies boundaries, with increasing encroachment of North Sea seals on areas previously occupied by the Baltic Sea subspecies. Further, both demographic and genetic data indicate that the two subspecies have begun to overlap geographically and are hybridizing in a narrow contact zone. Our findings provide new insights into the processes of colonization, extinction and recolonization and have important implications for the management of grey seals across northern Europe.",morten.olsen@snm.ku.dk,2016,10.1111/mec.13748,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,RC,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,popsize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper should be in the diversity section, only historical sampling included were in diversity and connectivity analyses; historical samples only have 1 mito 400bp region",,,,,,,,,,

Divergence times were generated using BEAST to estimate when isolation in putative refugia occurred. Patterns and timing of demographic expansion was performed using Bayesian skyline plot. Putative climatic refugia resulting from Quaternary climate change were identified using paleoecological niche modeling and divergence dates compared to major vicariant events associated with Pre-Pleistocene conditions. We recovered three major mitochondrial clades corresponding to western North America (California, Baja, and across the Great Basin), east-central North America (Texas, central Mexico, New Mexico), and southwestern Arizona/northwestern Mexico. Time to most recent common ancestor for S. gracilis occurred similar to 1.36Ma. Divergence times for each major clade occurred between 0.25 and 0.12Ma, with signature of population expansion occurring 0.15 and 0.10Ma. Ecological niche models identified three potential climatic refugia during the Last Interglacial, (1) west coast of California and Oregon, (2) northwestern Mexico, and (3) southern Texas/northeastern Mexico as well as two refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum, (1) western USA and (2) southern Texas/northeastern Mexico. This study supports PPD in shaping species-level diversity compared to QCC-driven changes at the intraspecific level for Spilogale, similar to the patterns reported for other small mammals (e.g., rodents and bats). Phylogeographic patterns also appear to have been shaped by both habitat and river vicariance, especially across the desert southwest.

496,,Historical Population Size Change and Differentiation of Relict Populations of the Endangered Giant Kangaroo Rat,"Statham, MJ; Bean, WT; Alexander, N; Westphal, MF; Sacks, BN","From a conservation management perspective it is important to understand how genetic diversity is partitioned across a species' range, including 1) identification of evolutionarily distinct units versus those recently isolated through anthropogenic activities and 2) the relative genetic contributions among components of fragmented (meta)populations. To address these questions, we investigated the phylogeography and metapopulation structure among relict populations of the endangered giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens) in the highly altered San Joaquin Desert Ecosystem. This keystone species underwent a similar to 97% range reduction over the past century, resulting in a current range that is highly fragmented, with 2 dominant northern and southern populations occurring 150 km apart. We sequenced >800 bp of mitochondrial DNA and genotyped 17 nuclear microsatellites in >275 D. ingens to assess the evolutionary relationship of these populations as well as the genetic structure within the northern metapopulation. A Bayesian Skyline Plot indicated that the species experienced a demographic expansion toward the end of the Pleistocene, with a recent population decline. Northern and southern D. ingens split 1857-13443 years ago, prior to the massive conversion of the San Joaquin Valley to irrigated agriculture. We recommend that the northern and southern populations of D. ingens be re-classified as distinct population segments under the United States Endangered Species Act. We also observed population structure and asymmetrical migration within northern D. ingens where the Tumey Hills acted as a source contributing gene flow to all peripheral populations.

Using this data set of diverse markers, it was possible to determine the species' demography at three temporal stages. Nuclear intron data revealed early colonization into Europe from the east, which pre-dates the Quaternary glaciations. The mtDNA data supported multiple glacial refugia across the Mediterranean, the largest of which were found in the Ibero-Maghreb region and an eastern location (Anatolia/Middle East)-that were used by R. hipposideros during the most recent glacial cycles. Finally, microsatellites provided the most recent information on these species' movements since the Last Glacial Maximum and suggested that lineages that had diverged into glacial refugia, such as in the Ibero-Maghreb region, have remained isolated.

Violations of these assumptions may impact population-level parameter estimation and lead to spurious inferences. Here, we used targeted capture to sequence the full mitochondrial genome from 123 individuals of the Galapagos giant tortoise endemic to Pinzon Island (Chelonoidis duncanensis) sampled at 2 time points pre- and postbottleneck (circa 1906 and 2014) to explicitly assess differences in diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions based on subsets of the mitochondria! genome versus the full sequences and to evaluate potential biases associated with diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions from postbottlenecked samples alone. Haplotypic diversities were equal between the temporal samples based on the full mitochondrial genome, but single gene estimates suggested either decreases or increases in diversity depending upon the region. Demographic reconstructions based on the full sequence were more similar between the temporal samples than those based on the control region alone, or a subset of 3 regions, where the trends in population size changes shifted in magnitude and direction between the temporal samples. In all cases, the estimated coalescent point was more distant for the historical than contemporary sample.

Subsequently, the population has been monitored by radio-tracking and collecting data on bear signs and observations. In 2000 we started a genetic monitoring program of the population with the aim to obtain data on population size, sex ratio, relationships as well as movements of individuals. We present results from six years of genetic monitoring, which were combined with field observations. During this time 1,005 hair and faecal samples were gathered in an area of[ 3,000 km(2), most of them in the core area of <1,000 km(2). Furthermore we analysed blood samples from captured individuals. Eight microsatellite and two sex determination loci were employed for DNA profiling. The number of detected individuals is surprisingly low, ranging from 5-8 per year. Concerning relationships the analysis reveals that all genotyped individuals are descendants of the founder individuals indicating that no immigration took place. Only one male and three females (mother and 2 daughters) took part in reproduction. Considering the fact that 28 bears were born in this region since 1991 the question arises where the bears disappear to. Our results suggest that subadult bears migrate from the core area.

5049,,Reproductive synchrony in a recovering bottlenecked sea turtle population,"Plot, V; de Thoisy, B; Blanc, S; Kelle, L; Lavergne, A; Roger-Berubet, H; Tremblay, Y; Fossette, S; Georges, JY","1. The assessment of species extinction risk has been well established for some time now. Assessing the potential for recovery in endangered species is however much more challenging, because complementary approaches are required to detect reliable signals of positive trends. 2. This study combines genetics, demography and behavioural data at three different time-scales to assess historical and recent population changes and evidence of reproductive synchrony in a small population of olive ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. Lepidochelys is considered as the most extraordinary example of reproductive synchrony in reptiles, yet to date, it has only been reported in large populations. 3. Using Bayesian coalescent-based models on microsatellite nuclear DNA variability, we demonstrate that effective population size in olive ridleys nesting in French Guiana has dramatically declined by 99% over the last 20 centuries. This low current population size is further illustrated by the absence of genetic mitochondrial DNA diversity in the present nesting population. Yet, monitoring of nesting sites in French Guiana suggests a possible recovery of the population over the last decade. 4. Satellite telemetry shows that over the first 14 days of their 28-days inter-nesting interval, i.e. when eggs maturation is likely to occur, gravid females disperse over the continental shelf. They then gather together with a striking spatiotemporal consistency close to the nesting site, where they later emerge for their second nesting event. 5. Our results therefore suggest that reproductive synchrony also occurs in small populations. Olive ridleys may ensure this synchrony by adjusting the duration of the second half of their internesting interval prior to landing, possibly through social mediation. 6. Such reproductive synchrony may be related to the maintenance of some species-specific strategy despite former collapse and may contribute to the present population recovery. The gregarious behaviour of reproductive individuals close to shore where human-induced perturbations occur is however a cause for conservation concern for this still poorly known species.",jean-yves.georges@iphc.cnrs.fr,2012,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01915.x,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,historical-dna,ACS,Kyle,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8316,,Demographic Rates and Population Viability of Black Bears in Louisiana,"Laufenberg, JS; Clark, JD; Hooker, MJ; Lowe, CL; O'Connell-Goode, KC; Troxler, JC; Davidson, MM; Chamberlain, MJ; Chandler, RB","The Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus) was reduced to a few small, fragmented, and isolated subpopulations in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley by the mid-twentieth century resulting from loss and fragmentation of habitat. In 1992, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) granted the Louisiana black bear threatened status under the United States Endangered Species Act of 1973. Since that time, a recovery plan was developed, a reintroduced population was established, and habitat recovery has occurred. The Recovery Plan states that a minimum of 2 populations must be viable (i.e., persistence probabilities over 100 years >0.95), 1 in the Tensas River Basin and 1 in the Atchafalaya River Basin. Consequently, our objectives were to 1) estimate demographic rates of Louisiana black bear subpopulations, 2) develop data-driven stochastic population projection models, and 3) determine how different projection model assumptions affect population trajectories and predictions about long-term persistence. Our overall goal was to assess long-term persistence of the bear subpopulations in Louisiana, individually and as a whole. We collected data using varying combinations of non-invasive DNA sampling, live capture, winter den visits, and radio monitoring from 2002 to 2012 in the 4 areas currently supporting breeding subpopulations in Louisiana: Tensas River Basin (TRB), Upper Atchafalaya River Basin (UARB), Lower Atchafalaya River Basin (LARB), and a recently reintroduced population at the Three Rivers Complex (TRC). From 2002 to 2012, we radio monitored fates of 86 adult females within the TRB and 43 in the TRC. Mean estimates of annual adult survival for the TRB and TRC were 0.997 and 0.990, respectively, when unknown fates were assumed alive and 0.970 and 0.926 when unknown fates were assumed dead. From 2003 to 2013, we observed 130 cub litters from 74 females in the TRB, and 74 cub litters from 45 females in the TRC. During the same period, we observed 43 yearling litters for 33 females in the TRB and 21 yearling litters for 19 females in the TRC. The estimated number of cubs and number of yearlings produced per breeding adult female was 0.47 and 0.20, respectively, in the TRB and 0.32 and 0.18 in the TRC. On the basis of matrix projection models, asymptotic growth rates ranged from 1.053 to 1.078 for the TRB and from 1.005 to 1.062 for the TRC, depending on how we treated unresolved fates of adult females. Persistence probabilities estimated from stochastic population models based on telemetry data ranged from 0.997 to 0.998 for the TRC subpopulation depending on model assumptions and were > 0.999 for the TRB regardless of model assumptions. We extracted DNA from hair collected at baited, barbed-wire enclosures in the TRB, UARB, and LARB to determine individual identities for capture-mark-recapture (CMR) analysis. We used those detection histories to estimate apparent survival (phi), per-capita recruitment (f), abundance (N), realized growth rate (lambda), and long-term viability, based on Bayesian hierarchical modeling methods that allowed estimation of temporal process variance and parameter uncertainty. Based on 23,312 hair samples, annual N for females in the TRB ranged from 133 to 164 during 2006-2012, depending on year and how detection heterogeneity was modeled. Geometric mean of lambda ranged from 0.996 to 1.002. In the UARB, we collected 11,643 hair samples from 2007 to 2012, from which estimates of N for females ranged from 23 to 43 during the study period, depending on detection heterogeneity model. The geometric mean of lambda ranged from 1.038 to 1.059. Estimated N for females in LARB ranged from 69 to 96, and annual lambda ranged from 0.80 to 1.11 based on 3,698 hair samples collected during 2010-2012, also depending on year and heterogeneity model. Probabilities of persistence over 100 years for the TRC and TRB based on stochastic matrix projection models that used vital rate estimates from telemetry data were >0.95 for all scenarios. Probability of persistence at the TRB and the UARB based on projection models that used vital rate estimates from CMR analyses ranged from 0.928 to 0.954 and from 0.906 to 0.959, respectively, depending on model assumptions. Data from the LARB were insufficient for a viability assessment. Thus, individual persistence probabilities for TRB and UARB did not meet the strict definition of viability (i.e., >0.95) under some model assumptions. However, the joint probability of bears persisting either in the TRB or UARB was >0.993 assuming individual population dynamics were independent and was >0.958 assuming dynamics were perfectly correlated. Furthermore, including the TRC increased the joint probability of bears persisting somewhere in the TRB, UARB, or TRC to > 0.999 based on the most pessimistic individual persistence estimates from those subpopulations. Therefore, if the intent of specifying that 2 subpopulations should be viable was to ensure the persistence of Louisiana black bears somewhere within its historical range, then the viability threshold was met.

Thus, it is important to monitor not only the number of individuals in a population, but also how they are associated in groups and how those groups are distributed across the landscape. Adding to the challenge of obtaining such information with high precision for endangered and elusive species is the need for long-term collection of such data. In this study we compare sampling approaches and genotype non-invasive genetic samples to estimate the number and distribution of wild western lowland gorillas occupying a 100 km(2) area in Loango National Park, Gabon, for the periods 2005-2007 and 2014-2017. Based on the number of genotyped individuals we inferred a minimum of 83 gorillas during the first and 81 gorillas during the second study period. We also obtained similar capture-recapture population size estimates for the two periods despite variance in social dynamics like group formations, group dissolutions and individual dispersal. We furthermore found area fidelity for two groups that were sampled for 10-12 years, despite variation in group membership.

Therefore, for threatened or endangered species, an understanding of the past is relevant when formulating conservation strategies. Levels of variation at neutral markers have been useful for estimating local effective population sizes (N-e) and inferring whether population sizes increased or decreased over time. Furthermore, analyses of genotypic, allelic frequency, and phylogenetic information can potentially be used to separate historical from recent demographic changes. For 15 populations of Galapagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis sp.), we used 12 microsatellite loci and DNA sequences from the mitochondrial control region and a nuclear intron, to reconstruct demographic history on shallow (past 100 generations, 2500years) and deep (pre-Holocene, >10 thousand years ago) timescales. At the deep timescale, three populations showed strong signals of growth, but with different magnitudes and timing, indicating different underlying causes. Furthermore, estimated historical N-e of populations across the archipelago showed no correlation with island age or size, underscoring the complexity of predicting demographic history a priori. At the shallow timescale, all populations carried some signature of a genetic bottleneck, and for 12 populations, point estimates of contemporary N-e were very small (i.e., < 50). On the basis of the comparison of these genetic estimates with published census size data, N-e generally represented 0.16 of the census size. However, the variance in this ratio across populations was considerable. Overall, our data suggest that idiosyncratic and geographically localized forces shaped the demographic history of tortoise populations. Furthermore, from a conservation perspective, the separation of demographic events occurring on shallow versus deep timescales permits the identification of naturally rare versus newly rare populations; this distinction should facilitate prioritization of management action.",rgarrick@olemiss.edu,2015,10.1002/ece3.1388,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,ACS,Kyle,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unsure if some of these are historical samples?,,,,,,,,,,
5296,,Low persistence in nature of captive reared rabbits after restocking operations,"Piorno, V; Villafuerte, R; Branco, M; Carneiro, M; Ferrand, N; Alves, P","The use of restocking of animals is common practice in the management of populations subject to hunting or recreational fishing. This practice encompasses the release of large numbers of individuals in an area where the species already exists, and thus it can have detrimental genetic impacts on the target populations, especially when captive-reared animals are involved. To better understand this practice and its conservation implications, we chose as a model the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a species of high economic and ecological importance, and often under intense management for hunting or conservation purposes, particularly after the large decline caused by rabbit hemorrhagic disease in the 90's. We studied the genetics of rabbit populations in an area where restocking with captive, wild-domestic hybrids was common. We collected a total of 503 samples from 15 hunting estates that had experienced differing restocking levels, as well as from five locations with no historical restocking and five game farms. All samples were analyzed to determine the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineage typical of the two European wild rabbit subspecies and domestic rabbit. Game farms and never restocked populations were very different in their haplotypic composition. In restocked areas, the proportion of the domestic lineage was higher when releases were recent and repeated, but this declined rapidly over time, in part due to selective removal by hunting. The extended use of this practice, considering the pronounced genetic and genotypic differences between domestic and wild rabbits, represents a potential danger to natural populations, especially given the marked decrease in wild rabbit numbers experienced in recent years in its original distribution range.",vicente.piorno.gonzalez@xunta.es,2015,10.1007/s10344-015-0934-4,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,historical-dna,BR,Brendan,reject,non-temporal,empirical,popsize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,iffy - using mtDNA to examine changes in stocking origin over the course of a few weeks (hunting season).

Given its rich palaeontological record, North Africa is a pertinent region for documenting the role of climate change and human mediated-habitat changes on the demography and genetic structure of faunal species. In the present study, we collected data from this species in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and we combined molecular (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, microsatellites), fossil, palaeoenvironmental, and human context data to propose an explanation for the fluctuations of populations belonging to the Meriones shawii complex in the past. Genetic and fossil data both indicate a strong bottleneck in Moroccan populations at the Middle Holocene (last interglacial optimum) compared to the Late Pleistocene. Our mitochondrial DNA data suggest a diversification event within Morocco corresponding to the 130-125 kya interglacial optimum. Given that (1) major demographic changes in the M.shawii complex coincide with the interglacial optimums, and (2) the impact of human activities on the landscape and faunal communities was moderate during the Middle Holocene (beginnings of the Neolithic culture), our results demonstrate that climate, rather than anthropogenic influences, likely explains the M.shawii complex population decline in the Holocene.",lalis@mnhn.fr,2016,10.1111/bij.12725,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,historical-dna,JW,Brendan,reject,non-temporal,empirical,popsize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BR - reject, non-temporal",,,,,,,,,,
1959,,Combining genetics with age/length data to estimate temporal changes in year-class strength of source populations contributing to mixtures,"Tsehaye, I; Brenden, TO; Bence, JR; Liu, WH; Scribner, KT; Kanefsky, J; Bott, K; Elliott, RF","We developed an approach for estimating changes in relative year-class strength of source populations contributing to mixtures by incorporating ages or lengths of mixture individuals in genetic stock identification models. The approach is intended for long-lived fishes with high pre-recruitment and low post-recruitment mortality rates for which consistent temporal changes in recruitment can be assumed. Age- and collection-year specific contributions of sources to the mixture are modeled as linear functions of two source-specific parameters: an intercept representing relative recruitment for the first modeled year class and a slope representing how relative recruitment changes annually. Based on simulations, the estimation approach performed reasonably well under diverse conditions, including varying numbers of sources, levels of genetic divergence among sources, degrees of change in year-class strength, durations and frequencies of sampling from mixtures, age ranges of individuals from mixtures, and sample sizes from mixtures. The estimation approach was also robust to aging error and uncertainty in length-age relationships. We applied the approach to genetic and length data for lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens from Green Bay, Lake Michigan, collected from 2002 to 2008, with sources corresponding to five Lake Michigan tributaries. Two of the Lake Michigan sources showed declining recruitment levels, whereas the other three sources showed increasing recruitment levels. We believe our proposed approach for indexing changes in year-class strength shows promise as a tool for identifying sources potentially at risk due to declining recruitment and for relating changes in recruitment to biotic or abiotic factors.

We found no significant changes in the allele frequencies for the Moray Firth population, while subtle but significant genetic changes over time were detected for the Bornholm Basin population. Estimates of the effective population size (N-e) generally exceeded 500 for both populations when employing a number of varieties of the temporal genetic method. However, confidence intervals were very wide and N-e's most likely range in the thousands. There was no apparent loss of genetic variability and no evidence of a genetic bottleneck for either of the populations. Calculations of the expected levels of genetic variability under different scenarios of N-e showed that the number of alleles commonly reported at microsatellite loci in Atlantic cod is best explained by N-e's exceeding thousand. Recent fishery-induced bottlenecks can, however, not be ruled out as an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between high levels of variability and recently reported estimates of N-e << 1000. From life history traits and estimates of survival rates in the wild, we evaluate the compatibility of the species' biology and extremely low N-e/N ratios. Our data suggest that very small N-e's are not likely to be of general concern for cod populations and, accordingly, most populations do not face any severe threat of losing evolutionary potential due to genetic drift.",nap@dfu.min.dk,2006,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02777.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,KC,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,marine,Actinopterygii,"Denmark, Scotland","Moray Firth, Bornholm Basin, Moray Firth, Bornholm Basin","2002.01.01,1997.01.01,1965.01.01,1928.01.01","71,62,50,50",1522.05,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,env_variation,,chronic,microsat,bone,dried,Pro K/Chelex procedure (Estoup et al. 1996),Sanger,PCR,tissue type was sagital otolith (inner ear),,,,,,,,,,

All individuals sampled (n = 242) were sub-adult or adults [701-1451 cm pre-caudal length (L-PC) range] with no neonates or YOY recorded in Bimini. Carcharhinus limbatus abundance peaked in September, coincident with the largest ratio of female to male sharks and a peak in fresh mating wounds on females. Mitochondrial control region (mtCR) DNA sequences were obtained from C. limbatus at Bimini to test whether Bimini C. limbatus are most closely related to geographically proximate populations sampled on the south-eastern coast of the U.S.A., the closest known nursery areas for this species. Nine mtCR haplotypes were observed in 32 individuals sampled at Bimini [haplotype diversity (h) = 0821, nucleotide diversity () = 00015]. Four haplotypes observed from Bimini matched those previously found in the northern Yucatan (Mexico)-Belize and two matched a haplotype previously found in the U.S.A. Four haplotypes were novel but were closely related to the northern Yucatan-Belizean haplotypes. Pair-wise phi(ST) analysis showed that Bimini was significantly differentiated from all of the populations previously sampled (U.S.A. Atlantic, U.S.A. Gulf of Mexico, northern Yucatan, Belize and Brazil). This indicates that C. limbatus sampled from Bimini are unlikely from the described, proximate U.S.A. nurseries.",katie@sharkconservancy.org,2015,10.1111/jfb.12821,JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,historical-dna,KC,Kyle,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6256,,Loss of historical immigration and the unsuccessful rehabilitation of extirpated salmon populations,"Fraser, DJ; Jones, MW; McParland, TL; Hutchings, JA","Comprehensive evaluations of multiple genetic factors are rarely undertaken in rehabilitation attempts of extirpated populations, despite a growing need to address why some rehabilitation projects succeed and others fail. Using temporally-spaced samples of microsatellite DNA, we tested several genetic hypotheses that might explain an unsuccessful attempt to re-establish Atlantic salmon populations (Salmo salar) in two rivers of the inner Bay of Fundy, Canada. Census sizes (N) in both populations plummeted to near zero from initial increases after reintroduction/human-mediated recolonization occurred. Over the same period (1974-1996), both populations were characterized by low or relatively low effective sizes (N (e) ) and temporally unstable genetic structuring, whereas neighbouring populations, known historically for their significant salmon production, were not. Despite evidence for genetic bottlenecking and continual linkage disequilibrium over time in both populations, neither exhibited detectable inbreeding or a significant loss of allelic diversity or heterozygosity relative to known donor/source populations. Ratios of N (e) to N also increased with decreasing N in both populations, implying a buffering capacity against losses of genetic diversity at depressed abundances. Most significantly, multiple lines of evidence were consistent with the hypothesis that there has been substantial and recurrent asymmetric migration (migration rate, m) from neighbouring areas into both populations even after initial rehabilitation. This included migration from a historically productive population that became extirpated during the course of rehabilitation efforts, indicating that both populations might have naturally depended on immigration from neighbouring areas for persistence. Our results highlight the value of incorporating temporal genetic data beyond commonly used metrics of neutral genetic diversity (F-ST, allelic richness, heterozygosity) to evaluate rehabilitation successes or failures. They also illustrate how the joint evaluation of multiple genetic concerns in rehabilitation attempts, at spatial scales beyond donor and rehabilitated populations, is useful for focusing future rehabilitation efforts.",dylan.fraser@dal.ca,2007,10.1007/s10592-006-9188-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,KC,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,diversity,,,no,freshwater,Actinopterygii,Canada,New Brunswick,,,1350.5,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,acute,microsat,scale,dried,Custom but similar to Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,sampling scheme in table 1,,,,,,,,,,
7489,,Life history and demographic determinants of effective/census size ratios as exemplified by brown trout (Salmo trutta),"Serbezov, D; Jorde, PE; Bernatchez, L; Olsen, EM; Vollestad, LA","A number of demographic factors, many of which related to human-driven encroachments, are predicted to decrease the effective population size (Ne) relative to the census population size (N), but these have been little investigated. Yet, it is necessary to know which factors most strongly impact Ne, and how to mitigate these effects through sound management actions. In this study, we use parentage analysis of a stream-living brown trout (Salmo trutta) population to quantify the effect of between-individual variance in reproductive success on the effective number of breeders (Nb) relative to the census number of breeders (Ni). Comprehensive estimates of the Nb/N ratio were reduced to 0.160.28, almost entirely due to larger than binomial variance in family size. We used computer simulations, based on empirical estimates of age-specific survival and fecundity rates, to assess the effect of repeat spawning (iteroparity) on Ne and found that the variance in lifetime reproductive success was substantially higher for repeat spawners. Random family-specific survival, on the other hand, acts to buffer these effects. We discuss the implications of these findings for the management of small populations, where maintaining high and stable levels of Ne is crucial to extenuate inbreeding and protect genetic variability.",d.r.serbezov@bio.uio.no,2012,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00239.x,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,temporal-genetics,KC,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,freshwater,Actinopterygii,Norway,Bellbekken,,,2263,pre-designed,natural,,,,acute,microsat,muscle,ethanol,Salt-based method outlined in Aljanabi & Martinez (1997),Sanger,PCR,"Complicated sampling scheme with parents from unkown years (2002-2005) but defined cohort sampling 2003-2005, even though all were used in analyses; No real driver/disturbance testing in the study",,,,,,,,,,
7696,,Re-examination of the historical range of the greater prairie chicken using provenance data and DNA analysis of museum collections,"Ross, JD; Arndt, AD; Smith, RFC; Johnson, JA; Bouzat, JL","The extent to which a species has declined within its historical range is commonly used as an important criterion in categorizing the conservation status of wild populations. The greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) has been extirpated from much of the area it once inhabited. However, within a large part of this area the species is not considered to be native, warranting no recovery effort or special protection. Demographic analysis based on provenance data from 238 specimens from museum collections in addition to genetic analyses of 100 mtDNA sequences suggest this species was native to the northern prairies, extending from central Minnesota to Alberta, Canada. Provenance data from 1879 to 1935 indicate that T. cupido would have required colonization and establishment of populations on an average 11,905 km(2) every year, with an estimated per capita growth rate of 8.9% per year. These rates seem unrealistic given the limited dispersal and high mortality rates reported for this species. A survey of mtDNA sequences from ''original'' and ''expanded'' ranges revealed no differences in levels of sequence diversity within ranges (pi = 0.018; SE = 0.004) but significant levels of genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.034; P = 0.013), which suggest that these populations have been relatively isolated for significant evolutionary time periods. DNA mismatch distributions fit a sudden expansion model consistent with a post-Pleistocene expansion of the species, which coincides with the expansion of prairies into the Canadian plains about 9000 years before present. This study demonstrates the value of museum collections as stores of ecological and genetic information fundamental for the conservation of natural populations, and suggests that the current status of the greater prairie chicken should be re-evaluated within all areas where this species may occur, but is now considered non-native.",jbouzat@bgnet.bgsu.edu,2006,10.1007/s10592-005-9110-9,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,KC,Brendan,reject,non-temporal,empirical,popsize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BR rejecting - uses museum samples but samples are partitioned spatially not temporally for analyses (except for one Fst analysis).

In central Australia, there are few non-flying, terrestrial species that are specialised floodplain occupants, and their persistence strategies are not well understood. 3. Using photographic mark-recapture and scat DNA, we observed a population of one such desert floodplain specialist, Slater's skink Liopholis slateri, over four years to understand how it persists in these disturbance-prone habitats. 4. We found evidence of a highly mobile, but site stable population, with spatial clustering of burrows into local 'neighbourhoods'. There were relatively low fluctuations in population size among years, with a second seasonal breeding event following heavy rain in January 2015. We observed both long-term residence of individuals and long-term use of burrows at the site. 5.

10434,,Evaluating the demographic history of the Seychelles kestrel (Falco araea): Genetic evidence for recovery from a population bottleneck following minimal conservation management,"Groombridge, JJ; Dawson, DA; Burke, T; Prys-Jones, R; Brooke, MD; Shah, N","An important requirement for biologists conserving vulnerable species of wildlife and managing genetic problems associated with small population size is to evaluate existing evidence regarding what is known of a species' recent population history. For endemic island species in particular, current genetic impoverishment could be due to either a recent population crash or a consequence of an evolutionary history of sustained isolation and small effective population size. Interpreting any given case can often be further complicated by incomplete or contradictory evidence from historical field surveys that might suggest a very different demographic history. Here, we use the case of the Seychelles kestrel (Falco araea), an island endemic previously listed as critically-endangered but now relatively common, to illustrate how genetic data from microsatellite genotypes of 100-150-year-old museum specimens reveals a recent and severe population crash since the 1940s to approximately eight individuals, before the population recovered. We re-interpret the historical population trajectory of the Seychelles kestrel in the light of the minimal intervention required for this species to recover. We examine different ecological explanations for the decline and apparently unassisted recovery of the Seychelles kestrel, review the evidence for similarly unaided recoveries elsewhere and discuss the implications of unaided population recoveries for future species conservation programmes. Demographic profiles from historical genetic signatures can provide highly informative evidence when evaluating past and future recovery efforts for endangered species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2594,,Effects of recent population bottlenecks on reconstructing the demographic history of prairie-chickens,"Johnson, JA; Dunn, PO; Bouzat, JL","Current methods of DNA sequence analysis attempt to reconstruct historical patterns of population structure and growth from contemporary samples. However, these techniques may be influenced by recent population bottlenecks, which have the potential to eliminate lineages that reveal past changes in demography. One way to examine the performance of these demographic methods is to compare samples from populations before and after recent bottlenecks. We compared estimates of demographic history from populations of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) before and after recent bottlenecks using four common methods (nested clade analysis [NCA], Tajima's D, mismatch distribution, and MDIV). We found that NCA did not perform well in the presence of bottleneck events, although it did recover some genetic signals associated with increased isolation and the extinction of intermediate populations. The majority of estimates for Tajima's D, including those from bottlenecked populations, were not significantly different from zero, suggesting our data conformed to neutral expectations. In contrast, mismatch distributions including the raggedness index were more likely to identify recently bottlenecked populations with this data set. Estimates of population mutation rate (theta), population divergence time (t), and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) from MDIV were similar before and after bottlenecks; however, estimates of gene flow (M) were significantly lower in a few cases following a bottleneck. These results suggest that caution should be used when assessing demographic history from contemporary data sets, as recently fragmented and bottlenecked populations may have lost lineages that affect inferences of their demographic history.",jeffaj@umich.edu,2007,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03285.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,RC,Brendan,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,terrestrial,Aves,"USA, Canada","Alberta, Manitoba, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, Louisiana, South Dakota","1999.01.01,1984.01.01,1970.01.01,1966.01.01,1964.01.01,1958.01.01,1955.01.01,1953.01.01,1948.01.01,1945.01.01,1942.01.01,1941.01.01,1940.01.01,1939.01.01,1938.01.01,1937.01.01,1936.01.01,1935.01.01,1934.01.01,1933.01.01,1932.01.01,1929.01.01,1928.01.01,1927.01.01,1926.01.01,1925.01.01,1923.01.01,1922.01.01,1921.01.01,1920.01.01,1915.01.01,1914.01.01,1912.01.01,1911.01.01,1910.01.01,1909.01.01,1907.01.01,1906.01.01,1905.01.01,1904.01.01,1903.01.01,1902.01.01,1901.01.01,1898.01.01,1897.01.01,1896.01.01,1895.01.01,1893.01.01,1891.01.01,1890.01.01,1888.01.01,1887.01.01,1885.01.01,1884.01.01,1883.01.01,1882.01.01,1880.01.01,1879.01.01,1878.01.01,1862.01.01,1859.01.01,1854.01.01,1847.01.01","250,32,1,2,1,1,1,73,2,3,3,7,3,2,4,4,3,3,3,4,2,6,7,3,2,4,2,3,9,1,7,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3,2,3,1,3,3,2,5,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,7,1,1,1",365,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,skin,dried,Phenol/chloroform + Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,missing date for 1 historic individual.

Although the calibration of demographic transition (CDT) method is the most promising rate calibration technique for population-level events, there is a risk of making the false assumption that post-glacial population expansions coincided with global temperature rise. Further generalization of the technique is required to evaluate population histories of marine species whose abundance may be independent of changes in temperature. We explored the population history of a dwarf eelpout Petroschmidtia teraoi on Japanese continental slopes in the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk as a model organism for phylogeographic study. For rate calibration, we estimated historical stock sizes from a species distribution model and incorporated this data into the CDT method as a proxy for demographic transition (we term this combined method extended CDT, or eCDT). Our species distribution model showed that the range of P. teraoi is mainly determined by water depth and locality (i.e., latitude and longitude). Reconstructed historical stock sizes revealed contrasting demographic trends in the northern and western Sea of Japan on either side of the Noto peninsula, located at the midpoint of the Japanese mainland. We also found a sharp genetic break in the same location, and inferred contrasting demographic histories of local populations from the molecular data. The striking differences in the demographic histories of local populations even on apparently continuous continental slopes are most likely due to differences in available habitat area. eCDT appeared to work well as a rate calibration method for our temperature-independent study species, and our species distribution model revealed that local populations could have diverged due to discontinuities in available habitat. Finally, we assessed the strengths and weakness of the novel calibration method by analyzing simulated sequences.",keisakuma@affre.go.jp,2020,10.1016/j.dsr.2020.103399,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS,historical-dna,RC,Kyle,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4789,,Relict or colonizer? Extinction and range expansion of penguins in southern New Zealand,"Boessenkool, S; Austin, JJ; Worthy, TH; Scofield, P; Cooper, A; Seddon, PJ; Waters, JM","Recent human expansion into the Pacific initiated a dramatic avian extinction crisis, and surviving taxa are typically interpreted as declining remnants of previously abundant populations. As a case in point, New Zealand's endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) is widely considered to have been more abundant and widespread in the past. By contrast, our genetic and morphological analyses of prehistoric, historic and modern penguin samples reveal that this species expanded its range to the New Zealand mainland only in the last few hundred years. This range expansion was apparently facilitated by the extinction of M. antipodes' previously unrecognized sister species following Polynesian settlement in New Zealand. Based on combined genetic and morphological data, we describe this new penguin species, the first known to have suffered human-mediated extinction. The range expansion of M. antipodes so soon after the extinction of its sister species supports a historic paradigmatic shift in New Zealand Polynesian culture. Additionally, such a dynamic biological response to human predation reveals a surprising and less recognized potential for species to have benefited from the extinction of their ecologically similar sister taxa and highlights the complexity of large-scale extinction events.",sanneboessenkool@gmail.com,2009,10.1098/rspb.2008.1246,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,ancient-dna,KC,Kyle,reject,phylogenetics,empirical,popsize,,,,no,terrestrial,Reptilia,New Zealand,"South Island, Stewart Island, Aukland Islands, Campbell Islands",,,1387,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,muscle,dried,Qiagen/Invitrogen,Sanger,PCR,"After reading thoroughly it should be rejected, the paper only uses DNA to make a phylogeny and determine extinction of a ""new species"", no other analyses for pop size or other metrics we are interested in; DNA extraction: ""historic"" from toe-pad and ""pre-historic"" from bone, both dried; generation time source: 10.7717/peerj.2935",,,,,,,,,,

(Fagales: Fagaceae), in coastal parts of New England, United States. Like many newly described and/or newly introduced species, it is unclear how long populations of Z. davisae have existed in this region. However, as this species forms galls on the woody-tissue of its host, it may be possible to obtain historical information about changes in its population size by examining the presence of galls in relation to annual growth nodes. Here, we explore the utility of this approach to determine population size changes in Z. davisae densities on Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, through dissection of black oak branches. In addition, we calculated parasitism rates during the years of study and obtained morphological and molecular identifications for the parasitoids associated with Z. davisae. Our results show significant changes in population sizes, with higher levels of parasitism at sites on Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod compared to sites on Nantucket. In addition, morphological examinations, in combination with DNA sequencing, identified the associated parasitoids as five species in the genus Sycophila Walker (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae). We comment that considerable morphological variation within several of these recovered species was observed, present the first record of males for a species from which only females have been described, and suggest that future work is required to clarify the species boundaries for this important parasitoid group.",jandersen@berkeley.edu,2019,10.1093/ee/nvz115,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,historical-dna,ACS,Kyle,reject,species_identification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3984,,"Effective size, census size, and genetic monitoring of the endangered razorback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus","Turner, TF; Dowling, TE; Marsh, PC; Kesner, BR; Kelsen, AT","For the past several decades the Lake Mohave population of the federally endangered razorback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus, has had no natural recruitment because of intensive predation on larvae by non-native fishes. In response to impending extirpation, a repatriation program was implemented where larval razorbacks are collected from the wild following natural spawning, reared in protective custody, and then repatriated at a much larger size. In this study, we estimated annual (N-bf) and generational female effective size (N-ef) of the spawning stock by characterizing temporal genetic changes in mtDNA among larval cohorts, and then compared these estimates to the estimated number of reproductively capable (adult) females in Lake Mohave (N-f). Razorback suckers have life history and mortality schedules that could yield values of N-ef/N-f as low as 10(-5) due to match-mismatch recruitment (or the """"Hedgecock effect"""") that increases variance in reproductive success. Average N (bf) was estimated to be 160, N-ef was 706, and the ratio N-ef/N-f was 0.29 and 0.38 for arithmetic and harmonic mean N (f), respectively. Our findings indicate that (i) larval sampling in Lake Mohave sufficiently encompasses temporal and spatial variation within annual larval cohorts as to be representative of the spawning stock, (ii) roughly 3-16% (about 8% on average) of adult females contribute genetically to larval cohorts each year, and (iii) repatriated fishes appear to be contributing genetically to larval cohorts.

6153,,Molecular insights into the historic demography of bowhead whales: understanding the evolutionary basis of contemporary management practices,"Phillips, CD; Hoffman, JI; George, JC; Suydam, RS; Huebinger, RM; Patton, JC; Bickham, JW","Patterns of genetic variation observed within species reflect evolutionary histories that include signatures of past demography. Understanding the demographic component of species' history is fundamental to informed management because changes in effective population size affect response to environmental change and evolvability, the strength of genetic drift, and maintenance of genetic variability. Species experiencing anthropogenic population reductions provide valuable case studies for understanding the genetic response to demographic change because historic changes in the census size are often well documented. A classic example is the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, which experienced dramatic population depletion due to commercial whaling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Consequently, we analyzed a large multi-marker dataset of bowhead whales using a variety of analytical methods, including extended Bayesian skyline analysis and approximate Bayesian computation, to characterize genetic signatures of both ancient and contemporary demographic histories. No genetic signature of recent population depletion was recovered through any analysis incorporating realistic mutation assumptions, probably due to the combined influences of long generation time, short bottleneck duration, and the magnitude of population depletion. In contrast, a robust signal of population expansion was detected around 70,000 years ago, followed by a population decline around 15,000 years ago. The timing of these events coincides to a historic glacial period and the onset of warming at the end of the last glacial maximum, respectively. By implication, climate driven long-term variation in Arctic Ocean productivity, rather than recent anthropogenic disturbance, appears to have been the primary driver of historic bowhead whale demography.",caleb.phillips@ttu.edu,2013,10.1002/ece3.374,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ancient-dna,JW,Kyle,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8619,,Contemporary and historical effective population sizes of Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus,"Waldman, J; Alter, SE; Peterson, D; Maceda, L; Roy, N; Wirgin, I","Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) is an anadromous fish of considerable conservation concern, following its long history of overfishing and exposure to a variety of other anthropogenic stressors. Though reaching a large size, population abundances (Nc) of Atlantic sturgeon are not easily surveyed using traditional fishery methods because of their relative scarcity and their many age classes, often exhibiting extensive and differential movements that render them not readily amenable to traditional sampling efforts. A metric of their vulnerability to inbreeding and a possible alternative to Nc for abundance monitoring is effective population size (Ne). We surveyed 14 Atlantic sturgeon populations across their range using a suite of DNA microsatellite markers. Contemporary levels of Ne ranged from 1 in the St. Marys River, Florida-Georgia, to 156 in the Hudson River, New York. Historical Ne estimates averaged about 11.5xhigher than contemporary estimates, with a high of 927 for the Kennebec River population. Because of a mix of life history characteristics that make traditional Ne estimates based on imperfectly mixed year classes of juveniles questionable, we propose and provide results ofa new, more robust and diagnostic approach based on sequential cohorts, termed Ne Max. Although contemporary Ne values obtained were at levels that might be considered troublesome, we suggest that the unique life history factors of this species may render it more resistant than other taxa to inbreeding effects. Because of the many differences among populations in size, age, and sex ratio and in harvest histories, we do not believe that a reliable extrapolation factor between Ne and Nc is yet possible. However, ongoing monitoring of Ne and Nc in populations might be sensitive to population changes and could form the basis of determining a relationship between Ne and Nc.",john.waldman@qc.cuny.edu,2019,10.1007/s10592-018-1121-4,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,JW,Brendan,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,other,Actinopterygii,"USA, Canada","Maine, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, New Brunswick, Quebec ","2017.01.01,2016.01.01,2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,1998.01.01,1996.01.01,1993.01.01,1992.01.01,1980.01.01","169,170,216,487,85,162,50,132,26,32,101,81,53,66,123,19",5110,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,invasive_species,chronic,microsat,skin,ethanol,phenol/chloroform,Sanger,PCR,generation time varies across range + populations sampled,,,,,,,,,,

We applied genetic monitoring to the reintroduced brown bear population in northern Italy. From 2002 to 2008, 2781 hair and faecal samples collected noninvasively plus 12 samples obtained from captured or dead bears were used to follow the demographic and geographical expansion and changes in genetic composition. Individual genotypes were used to reconstruct the wild pedigree and revealed that the population increased rapidly, from nine founders to > 27 individuals in 2008 (lambda = 1.17-1.19). Spatial mapping of bear samples indicated that most bears were distributed in the region surrounding the translocation site; however, individual bears were found up to 163 km away. Genetic diversity in the population was high, with expected heterozygosity of 0.74-0.79 and allelic richness of 4.55-5.41. However, multi-year genetic monitoring data showed that mortality rates were elevated, immigration did not occur, one dominant male sired all cubs born from 2002 to 2005, genetic diversity declined, relatedness increased, inbreeding occurred, and the effective population size was extremely small (Ne = 3.03, ecological method). The comprehensive information collected through genetic monitoring is critical for implementing future conservation plans for the brown bear population in the Italian Alps.

7726,,Gene flow counteracts the effect of drift in a Swiss population of snow voles fluctuating in size,"Garcia-Navas, V; Bonnet, T; Waldvogel, D; Wandeler, P; Camenisch, G; Postma, E","Genetic monitoring has emerged as a useful tool to better understand evolutionary processes acting within and among natural populations. Longitudinal studies allow the examination of temporal changes in neutral genetic patterns in relation to demographic data, which is particularly interesting in populations that undergo large fluctuations in size. Taking advantage of eight years (2006-2013) of genetic survey data (18 microsatellite loci) from a snow vole (Chionomys nivalis) population in the Swiss Alps, we explore whether and how gene flow and selection shape temporal variability in genetic diversity by counteracting the effect of genetic drift, and thereby maintain the high levels of heterozygosity observed in this population. Using simulations and empirical data, we show that effective population size is small, and that genetic drift would lead to a marked decline in genetic diversity. However, this force is counterbalanced by the restoring effect of immigration. In agreement with the predictions of neutral genetic theory, we found a strong, positive association between genetic diversity and population size, which suggests positive density-dependent dispersal. This is also supported by the observed changes in genetic composition overtime. Meanwhile, selection for heterozygosity was weak, overriding the effect of drift only in one out of eight years. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of gene flow as a significant evolutionary force in shaping genetic patterns in the wild, and as a crucial-process for the maintenance of genetic diversity in small populations.

9240,,Temporal Analysis of Genetic Structure to Assess Population Dynamics of Reintroduced Swift Foxes,"Cullingham, CI; Moehrenschlager, A","Reintroductions are increasingly used to reestablish species, but a paucity of long-term postrelease monitoring has limited understanding of whether and when viable populations subsequently persist. We conducted temporal genetic analyses of reintroduced populations of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) in Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and the United States (Montana). We used samples collected 4 years apart, 17 years from the initiation of the reintroduction, and 3 years after the conclusion of releases. To assess program success, we genotyped 304 hair samples, subsampled from the known range in 2000 and 2001, and 2005 and 2006, at 7 microsatellite loci. We compared diversity, effective population size, and genetic connectivity over time in each population. Diversity remained stable over time and there was evidence of increasing effective population size. We determined population structure in both periods after correcting for differences in sample sizes. The geographic distribution of these populations roughly corresponded with the original release locations, which suggests the release sites had residual effects on the population structure.

8833,,Comparative estimation of effective population sizes and temporal gene flow in two contrasting population systems,"Fraser, DJ; Hansen, MM; Ostergaard, S; Tessier, N; Legault, M; Bernatchez, L","Estimation of effective population sizes (N-e) and temporal gene flow (N(e)m, m) has many implications for understanding population structure in evolutionary and conservation biology. However, comparative studies that gauge the relative performance of N-e, N(e)m or m methods are few. Using temporal genetic data from two salmonid fish population systems with disparate population structure, we (i) evaluated the congruence in estimates and precision of long- and short-term N-e, N(e)m and m from six methods; (ii) explored the effects of metapopulation structure on N-e estimation in one system with spatiotemporally linked subpopulations, using three approaches; and (iii) determined to what degree interpopulation gene flow was asymmetric over time. We found that long-term N-e estimates exceeded short-term N-e within populations by 2-10 times; the two were correlated in the system with temporally stable structure (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar) but not in the highly dynamic system (brown trout, Salmo trutta). Four temporal methods yielded short-term N-e estimates within populations that were strongly correlated, and these were higher but more variable within salmon populations than within trout populations. In trout populations, however, these short-term N-e estimates were always lower when assuming gene flow than when assuming no gene flow. Linkage disequilibrium data generally yielded short-term N-e estimates of the same magnitude as temporal methods in both systems, but the two were uncorrelated. Correlations between long- and short-term geneflow estimates were inconsistent between methods, and their relative size varied up to eightfold within systems. While asymmetries in gene flow were common in both systems (58-63% of population-pair comparisons), they were only temporally stable in direction within certain salmon population pairs, suggesting that gene flow between particular populations is often intermittent and/or variable. Exploratory metapopulation N-e analyses in trout demonstrated both the importance of spatial scale in estimating N-e and the role of gene flow in maintaining genetic variability within subpopulations. Collectively, our results illustrate the utility of comparatively applying N-e, N(e)m and m to (i) tease apart processes implicated in population structure, (ii) assess the degree of continuity in patterns of connectivity between population pairs and (iii) gauge the relative performance of different approaches, such as the influence of population subdivision and gene flow on N-e estimation. They further reiterate the importance of temporal sampling replication in population genetics, the value of interpreting N-e or m in light of species biology, and the need to address long-standing assumptions of current N-e, N(e)m or m models more explicitly in future research.",dylan.fraser@dal.ca,2007,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03453.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,BR,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,connectivity,,,no,marine,Actinopterygii,"Canada, Denmark",,,,,opportunistic,natural,,,,chronic,microsat,scale,dried,Pro K,Sanger,PCR,"multiple sampling schemes with some populations only having 1 sample, others have multiple; they used 6 different methods for estimating metrics; multiple extraction types: (Tessier 1999, pro K (Estoup 1996); Ostergaard 2003, Chelex resin (Estoup 1996); Hansen 2002, phenol-chlorophorm (Nielsen 1999) and/or proK-chelex (Estoup 1996));",,,,,,,,,,

Reintroduction of pregnant females has been proposed as a means of maximising productivity and genetic diversity, but it is unclear whether the release of pregnant females increases the effective number of founders. Ten male and 20 gravid female egg-laying skinks (Oligosoma suteri) were reintroduced to Korapuki Island from Green Island, New Zealand in 1992. We sampled the populations on both Green and Korapuki Islands to examine the effect of reintroduction on the genetic structure and fitness of egg-laying skinks following release. The population on Korapuki Island showed multiple genetic signatures of a bottleneck that were not detected in the population on Green Island. At the individual level, juveniles on Korapuki Island were more homozygous than adults on Korapuki and Green Islands. However, we did not find evidence of inbreeding depression using two performance-based surrogates of fitness. Further, the population on Korapuki Island had a significantly larger effective population size than would have been expected by reintroduction of 30 skinks, based on 10,000 simulated populations. The reintroduction of gravid females aided in increasing the effective number of founders, and may be a viable option for maximizing genetic diversity in reintroduced populations, particularly for long-lived species.

Here, we investigate the impact of unstable population size and connectivity on genetic diversity and structure in a long-term genetic study of 298 Finnish wolves born in 19952009 and genotyped for 17 microsatellite loci. During the initial recovery and prior to population expansion, genetic diversity was high (19951997: LD-Ne=67.2; Ho=0.749; He=0.709) despite a small census size and low number of breeders (Nc<100; Nb<10) likely reflecting the status of the Russian source population. Surprisingly, observed heterozygosity decreased significantly during the study period (t=-2.643, P=0.021) despite population expansion, likely a result of an increase in inbreeding (FIS=0.108 in 20072009) owing to a low degree of connectivity with adjacent Russian wolf population (m=0.0160.090; FST=0.086, P<0.001) and population crash after 2006.

For example, effective population size (N-e) estimates are useful for determining the conservation status of species, yet accurate estimates of current N-e remain difficult to obtain. The effective population size can contribute to setting federal delisting criteria, as was done for the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). After being hunted to near extinction during the North Pacific fur trade, the southern sea otter has recovered over part of its former range, but remains at relatively low numbers, making it desirable to obtain accurate and consistent estimates of N-e. Although theoretical papers have compared the validity of several methods, comparisons of estimators using empirical data in applied conservation settings are limited. We combined thirteen years of demographic and genetic data from 1,006 sea otters to assess multiple N-e estimators, as well as temporal trends in genetic diversity and population genetic structure. Genetic diversity was low and did not increase over time. There was no evidence for distinct genetic units, but some evidence for genetic isolation by distance. In particular, estimates of N-e based on demographic data were much larger than genetic estimates when computed for the entire range of the population, but were similar at smaller spatial scales. The discrepancy between estimates at large spatial scales could be driven by cryptic population structure and/or individual differences in reproductive success. We recommend the development of new delisting criteria for the southern sea otter. We advise the use of multiple estimates of N-e for other wide-ranging species, species with overlapping generations, or with sex-biased dispersal, as well as the development of improved metrics of genetic assessments of populations.",Holly.Ernest@uwyo.edu,2018,10.1111/eva.12642,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,temporal-genetics,RC,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,diversity,,,no,marine,Mammalia,California,,"2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01","35,74,73,79,79,67,84,156,86,72,27,38,16",2883.5,opportunistic,natural,,,,acute,microsat,,,,Sanger,PCR,"Does not give locations sampled; Multiple sampling and extraction schemes with no delineation of historical samples (muscle, blood, hair, buccal swab; Qiagen for blood and tissue; QIAmp for hair and buccal swab)",,,,,,,,,,

One proposed application of genetic monitoring has been to estimate abundance and its trajectory through time. Here, genetic monitoring was conducted across five consecutive year for the Pecos bluntnose shiner, a federally threatened minnow. Temporal changes in allele frequencies at seven microsatellite DNA loci were used to estimate variance effective size (N-eV) across adjacent years in the time series. Likewise, effective size was computed using the linkage disequilibrium method (N-eD) for each sample. Estimates of N-e were then compared to estimates of adult fish density obtained from traditional demographic monitoring. For Pecos bluntnose shiner, density (catch-per-unit-effort), N-eV and N-eD were positively associated across this time series. Results for Pecos bluntnose shiner were compared to a related and ecologically similar species, the Rio Grande silvery minnow. In this species, density and N-eV were negatively associated, which suggested decoupling of abundance and effective size trajectories. Conversely, density and N-eD were positively associated. For Rio Grande silvery minnow, discrepancies among estimates of N-e and their relationships with adult fish density could be related to effects of high variance in reproductive success in the wild and/or effects of supplementation of the wild population with captive-bred and reared fish. The efficacy of N-e as a predictor of density and abundance may depend on intrinsic population dynamics of the species and how these dynamics are influenced by the landscape features, management protocols and other factors.",mosborne@unm.edu,2010,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04695.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,museum-dna,AAS,Brendan,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,freshwater,Actinopterygii,USA,New Mexico,"2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2002.01.01","331,252,338,139,22,172,107",496,pre-designed,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,env_variation,,chronic,microsat,skin,ethanol,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,,,,,,,,,,,

However, tracing its change through time is difficult in natural populations. We applied four new methods for estimating Ne from a single sample of genotypes to trace temporal change in Ne for bears in the Northern Dinaric Mountains. We genotyped 510 bears using 20 microsatellite loci and determined their age. The samples were organized into cohorts with regard to the year when the animals were born and yearly samples with age categories for every year when they were alive. We used the Estimator by Parentage Assignment (EPA) to directly estimate both Ne and generation interval for each yearly sample. For cohorts, we estimated the effective number of breeders (Nb) using linkage disequilibrium, sibship assignment and approximate Bayesian computation methods and extrapolated these estimates to Ne using the generation interval. The Ne estimate by EPA is 276 (183350 95% CI), meeting the inbreeding-avoidance criterion of Ne > 50 but short of the long-term minimum viable population goal of Ne > 500. The results obtained by the other methods are highly consistent with this result, and all indicate a rapid increase in Ne probably in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Apennine brown bears Ursus arctos marsicanus are a small, isolated population under a severe risk of extinction, for which the main demographic mechanisms underlying population dynamics are still unknown, and population trends have not been formally assessed. We present a 12-year analysis of their survival rates using non-invasive genetic sampling data collected through four different sampling techniques. By using multi-event capture-recapture models, we estimated survival probabilities for two broadly defined age classes (cubs and older individuals), even though the age of the majority of sampled bears was unknown. We also applied the Pradel model to provide a preliminary assessment of population trend during the study period.

This population constitutes an ideal model to document a founder event and ensuing genetic drift, with implications for conservation. Here we combined historical accounts, census and tagging data since the late 1960s, and genetic data (41 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences) from 84 individuals representing nearly all individuals present between 1990 and 2000 to investigate the history of the founding of the White Island population, document its population dynamics and evaluate possible future threats. We fully resolved parental relationships over three overlapping generations. Cytonuclear disequilibrium among the first generation suggested that it comprised the direct descendants of a founding group. We estimated that the White Island population was founded by a small group of individuals that accessed the island during a brief break in the surrounding sea ice in the mid-1950s, consistent with historical accounts. Direct and indirect methods of calculating effective population size were highly congruent and suggested a minimum founding group consisting of three females and two males. The White Island population showed altered reproductive dynamics compared to Erebus Bay, including highly skewed sex ratio, documented inbred mating events, and the oldest known reproducing Weddell seals. A comparison with the putative source population showed that the White Island population has an effective inbreeding coefficient (F (e)) of 0.29. Based on a pedigree analysis including the hypothesized founding group, 86% of the individuals for whom parents were known had inbreeding coefficients ranging 0.09-0.31. This high level of inbreeding was correlated with reduced pup survival. Seals at White Island therefore face the combined effects of low genetic variability, lack of immigration, and inbreeding depression.

This paper reports the first estimate of genetic N-e, of the Lake Trasimeno's northern pike, by means of microsatellites data, over the last four decades compared with five other significant Italian populations. N-e, values were evaluated through specific software and H estimator. The N-e, results confirm that. despite a marked reduction between 1966 and 1997 and a less than optimal status, the Trasimeno population shows a positive trend in its health status, presumably due to proper management programmes. Considerations on the biological conservation and management of this pike population are also reported. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

10214,,Reconciling genetic and demographic estimators of effective population size in the anuran amphibian Bufo calamita,"Rowe, G; Beebee, TJC","We used genetic and demographic methods to estimate the variance effective population sizes ( Ne) of three populations of natterjack toads Bufo calamita in Britain. This amphibian breeds in temporary pools where survival rates can vary among families. Census population sizes (N) were derived from spawn string counts. Point and coalescent-based maximum likelihood estimates of Ne based on microsatellite allele distributions were similar. N-e/N ratios based on genetic estimates of Ne ranged between 0.02 and 0.20. Mean demographic estimates of Ne were consistently higher (2.7-8.0-fold) than genetic estimates for all three populations when variance in breeding success was evaluated at the point where females no longer influence their progeny. However, discrepancies between genetic and demographic estimators could be removed by using a model that included extra variance in survivorship (above to Poisson expectations) among families. The implications of these results for the estimation of N-e in wild populations are discussed.",t.j.c.beebee@sussex.ac.uk,2004,10.1023/B:COGE.0000031145.06421.d3,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,KJ,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,terrestrial,Amphibia,England,"Ainsdale.Saltfleetby, Ainsdale.Saltfleetby","2000.01.01,1994.01.01","80,40",1642.5,pre-designed,natural,,,,acute,microsat,,ethanol,Chelex,Sanger,PCR,whole larvae used for extractions; no driver just comparisons of different populations for NE estimates,,,,,,,,,,
3113,,Estimating effective population size of guanacos in Patagonia: an integrative approach for wildlife conservation,"Sarno, RJ; Jennings, DE; Franklin, WL","By the mid-1900s the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) approached extinction in southern South America due to habitat destruction and hunting. In order to maintain the ecological prominence of this iconic species, as well as assist in the management of populations that are emerging economically while increasing in conservation value, accurate and potentially rapid estimates of effective population size (N-e) (demographic and/or genetic) are essential. Estimates of N-e generally focus on the genetic effective population size; however, we posited that both parameters may be necessary to provide more accurate and timely estimates. Therefore, we examined the performance of three demographic and four genetic estimators of N-e of guanacos in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, at different years and time intervals between 1987 and 1997. We compared our estimates with census estimates of the adult population size (N-ac) during the same time period. Average N-e/N-ac ratios of demographic estimates varied between 0.04 and 0.99 of the adult census size. Genetic estimates varied between 0.02 and 0.08 of the adult census size. Based upon group composition and population size (n = 82) of guanacos in 1975, the number of breeding adults was 44 animals. Mean N-e of the single-sample and temporal genetic estimators was 43.1, and 34.3, respectively; estimated N-e of one of the demographic estimators was 41. Our findings suggest that intermittent genetic estimates of N-e (via fecal samples, carcasses, blood collection during capture, and/or other non-invasive methods) can provide crucial information regarding the genetic integrity of increasingly isolated populations of wild South American camelids. Considering the overall performance of these estimators, and differences in how each functions, we recommend an integrative approach using both genetic and demographic estimators, to evaluate N-e for the wild South American camelids and other species with polygynous mating systems.",Ronald.Sarno@hofstra.edu,2015,10.1007/s10592-015-0730-4,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,KJ,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,terrestrial,Mammalia,Chile,Torres del Paine National Park,,,,opportunistic,natural,,,,,microsat,blood,ethanol,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,"they cite another article for microsat data, but the sample sizes are different than the paper, and they do not say how many samples they used from each cohort; no driver mentioned",,,,,,,,,,
11177,,Wolf survival and population trend using non-invasive capture-recapture techniques in the Western Alps,"Marucco, F; Pletscher, DH; Boitani, L; Schwartz, MK; Pilgrim, KL; Lebreton, JD","1. Reliable estimates of population parameters are often necessary for conservation management but these are hard to obtain for elusive, rare and wide-ranging species such as wolves Canis lupus. This species has naturally recolonized parts of its former habitat in Western Europe; however, an accurate and cost-effective method to assess population trend and survival has not been implemented yet. 2. We used open-model capture-recapture (CR) sampling with non-invasive individual identifications derived from faecal genotyping to estimate survival and trend in abundance for wolves in the Western Alps between 1999 and 2006. Our sampling strategy reduced individual heterogeneity in recaptures, thus minimizing bias and increasing the precision of the estimates. 3. Young wolves had lower apparent annual survival rates (0.24 +/- 0.06) than adult wolves (0.82 +/- 0.04); survival rates were lower in the summer than in the winter for both young and adults. The wolf population in the study area increased from 21 +/- 9.6 wolves in 1999 to 47 +/- 11.2 wolves in late winter 2005; the population growth rate (lambda = 1.04 +/- 0.27) was lower than that recorded for other recolonizing wolf populations. 4. We found a positive trend in wolf abundance, regardless of the method used. However, the abundance estimate based on snow-tracking was on average 36.2% (SD = 13.6%) lower than that from CR modelling, because young dispersing wolves are likely to have lower sign detection rates in snow-track surveys, a problem adequately addressed by CR sampling. 5. Synthesis and applications. We successfully implemented a new method to assess large carnivore population trend and survival at large spatial scales. These are the first such estimates for wolves in Italy and in the Alps and have important management implications. Our approach can be widely applied to broader spatial and temporal scales for other elusive and wide-ranging species in Europe and elsewhere.",francesca.marucco@centrograndicarnivori.it,2009,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01696.x,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KJ,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,,,,no,terrestrial,Mammalia,"Italy, France",,,,,pre-designed,natural,,,,,microsat,,ethanol,Qiagen and QIAmp,Sanger,PCR,"samples were scat; no driver, basically proof of method",,,,,,,,,,
1507,,Genetic diversity through time and space: diversity and demographic history from natural history specimens and serially sampled contemporary populations of the threatened Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae),"Bolton, PE; Rollins, LA; Brazill-Boast, J; Maute, KL; Legge, S; Austin, JJ; Griffith, SC","Declines in population size can compromise the viability of populations by reducing the effective population size (N-e), which may result in loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding. Temporal population genetic data can be a powerful tool for testing the presence and severity of reductions in N-e. The Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) is a flagship for conservation of Australian monsoonal savanna species. This species underwent severe population declines in the twentieth century due to land use changes associated with European colonization. Microsatellite and mitochondrial genetic data from Gouldian finch samples sourced from natural history collections prior to land use changes were compared with contemporary samples to estimate the severity of decline in effective population size and to detect changes in gene flow. These data show that Gouldian finch decline was not as severe as some sources suggest, and that population genetic connectivity has not changed following land use changes in the twentieth century. Multiple estimators of current N-e using genetic data from consecutive years suggest the Gouldian finch N-e is likely between a few hundred and a few thousand individuals, with some estimates within the range considered of conservation concern. This work has identified the need to genetically characterize populations in Queensland, and to understand critical demographic parameters (e.g. lifespan) in the Gouldian finch. Understanding these factors is vital to further improve genetic estimates of population size, key to the formation of appropriate conservation management of this species.",peri.bolton@mq.edu.au,2018,10.1007/s10592-018-1051-1,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,BR,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,diversity,,,no,terrestrial,Aves,Australia,,,,,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,chronic,microsat,skin,dried,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,"see table 1, complicated sampling scheme and cannot decipher which periods and sample types were used for temporal genetic analyses",,,,,,,,,,
