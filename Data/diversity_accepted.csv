8225,,Long-term stocking practices threaten the original genetic diversity of the southernmost European populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar,"Almodovar, A; Leal, S; Nicola, GG; Horreo, JL; Garcia-Vazquez, E; Elvira, B","Many Atlantic salmon Salmo salar populations in Europe are threatened by previous stocking with foreign hatchery strains. Temporal patterns of genetic characteristics of salmon from northern Spain, the southernmost European populations, were compared before and after species decline and heavy stocking with specimens from northern Europe. Eleven microsatellite loci were analysed in archival (scales from 1958-1960) and contemporary (2007-2008) samples from the River Sella. Temporal analyses revealed a similar heterozygosity between archival and contemporary samples, despite a drastic decrease in population abundance, while the contemporary sample showed a higher allelic richness due to the occurrence of foreign alleles. Considering only the alleles with at least 4 % frequency in the archival sample, 2 alleles exclusive to the River Sella were absent in the contemporary sample, and 14 alleles showed a decrease of at least 4 % frequency. Four alleles common in Scotland showed a high occurrence in the contemporary sample, so they are good candidates as markers of introgression of foreign genes. The heavy stocking with non-native Scottish broodstocks between 1970 and 1990 caused the introgression found in the contemporary sample when compared with the pristine population. An abrupt decrease was evident when the estimates of effective number of breeders were adjusted to take into account overlapping generations (Nb-Adj), effective population size (Ne-Adj) estimated from Nb-Adj, and number of breeders estimated using the sibship assignment method (Nb-SIB) The very low effective size values found in the contemporary sample, together with the detrimental synergy between genetic drift and high rates of introgression, represent a severe risk for the conservation of native salmon.",aalmodovar@bio.ucm.es,2020,10.3354/esr01029,ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH,temporal-genetics,KJ,JW,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,,other,Actinopterygii,Spain,River Sella,"2008.01.01,1959.01.01","146,172",2,1959.01.01,2008.01.01,1022,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,,chronic,microsat,"fin clips, scales",NA,"Chelex resin protocol (Estoup et al. 1996),QIAamp DNA Mini Kit",Sanger,PCR,"generation time: Consuegra et al 2005, present study; 2008 represents midpoint of 2007-2008, 1959 represents midpoint of 1958-1960","# of alleles, allele frequencies, AR, He, Ho, FIS, LD, HWE, phist","MICRO-CHECKERv2.2.3, CERVUS v3.0.3, ML-NullFreq, GENEPOPv4.1, GENETIXv4.05.2, FSTATv2.9.3, STATISTICAv8.0-chisq, ARLEQUINv3.5",,"8 microsat loci, 116(m) alleles, 92(h) alleles",,,,,,

In this study, we used direct sequencing of mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (28S and ITS) genes to compare genetic differences in presumed native and introduced populations in order to infer its introduction pattern and to shed light on the native range of this species. The temporal pattern of genetic diversity at the westernmost limit of the geographic range of P. pusilla in Europe (the Atlantic coast of southern Spain) over an eight-year period was also investigated. Our results confirm P. pusilla as a neocosmopolitan species and suggest that the species is native to the Atlantic coast of Central and South America. Paracaprella pusilla seems to have been introduced into European waters from multiple introduction pathways and source populations, which are likely to include populations from coastal waters of Brazil. Multiple introduction pathways may have been involved, with the most important being commercial shipping through the Strait of Gibraltar. While this tropical species appears to be expanding in the Mediterranean, populations from the westernmost limit of its geographic range in Europe showed a temporal instability. This study constitutes the first molecular approach focused on this species, but it is also the first study of temporal change in genetic diversity of any introduced marine amphipod. Additional intensive sampling of this species, including both native and non-native populations, and detailed temporal studies are still necessary to properly understand how genetic diversity influences the introduction and survival of P. pusilla in invaded areas.",pilarcabezas@cibio.up.pt,2019,10.3897/neobiota.47.32408,NEOBIOTA,temporal-genetics,AAS,JW,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,,marine,Amphipoda,Spain,Cadiz marina,"2017.08.01,2016.08.01,2011.08.01,2010.08.01","15,3,44,13",4,2010.08.01,2017.08.01,182.5,pre-designed,anthropogenic,invasive_species,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,"gnathopod,pereopod,antennae,gill",ethanol,PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit,Sanger,PCR,generation estimated from similar species: https://invasions.si.edu/nemesis/species_summary/-77,,,,,,,,,,
6831,,Linking genetic diversity and temporal fluctuations in population abundance of the introduced feral cat (Felis silvestris catus) on the Kerguelen archipelago,"Devillard, S; Santin-Janin, H; Say, L; Pontier, D","Linking temporal variations of genetic diversity, including allelic richness and heterozygosity, and spatio-temporal fluctuations in population abundance has emerged as an important tool for understanding demographic and evolutionary processes in natural populations. This so-called genetic monitoring was conducted across 12 consecutive years (19962007) at three sites for the feral cat, introduced onto the Kerguelen archipelago fifty years ago. Temporal changes in allelic richness and heterozygosity at 18 microsatellite DNA loci were compared with temporal changes in the adult population abundance index, obtained by typical demographic monitoring. No association was found at the island spatial scale, but we observed an association between genetic diversity and adult population indices from year to year within each study site. More particularly, the magnitude of successive increases or decreases in the adult population abundance index appeared to be the major factor linking the trajectories of genetic diversity and adult population abundance indices. Natal dispersal and/or local recruitment, both facilitated by high juvenile survival when the adult population size is small, is proposed as the major demographic processes contributing to such an observed pattern. Finally, we suggested avoiding the use of the harmonic mean as an estimator of long-term population size to study the relationships between demographic fluctuations and heterozygosity in populations characterized by strong multiannual density fluctuations.",sebastien.devillard@univ-lyon1.fr,2011,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05329.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,ACS,JW,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,connectivity,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,French Southern and Antarctic Lands,Grande Terre,"2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1997.01.01,1996.01.01","13,6,32,65,66,16,10,16,30,41,26,24",12,1996.01.01,2007.01.01,334,pre-designed,natural,competition,,,acute,microsat,NA,dried,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,generation time: https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/82598,,,,,,,,,,
8400,,Temporal analysis of archived samples indicates marked genetic changes in declining North Sea cod (Gadus morhua),"Hutchinson, WF; van Oosterhout, C; Rogers, SI; Carvalho, GR","Despite increasing evidence that current exploitation rates can contribute to shifts in life-history traits and the collapse of marine fish stocks, few empirical studies have investigated the likely evolutionary impacts. Here, we used DNA recovered from a temporal series of archived North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, to investigate genetic diversity within the Flamborough Head population between 1954 and 1998, during which time the population underwent two successive declines. Microsatellite data indicated a significant reduction in genetic diversity between 1954 and 1970 (total number of alleles: 1954, 46; 1960, 42; 1970, 37), and a subsequent recovery between 1970 and 1998 (total number of alleles: 1970, 37; 1981, 42; 1998, 45). Furthermore, estimates of genetic differentiation (F-ST and R-ST) showed a significant divergence between 1998 and earlier samples. Data are consistent with a period of prolonged genetic drift, accompanied by a replacement of the Flamborough Head population through an increased effective migration rate that occurred during a period of high exploitation and appreciable demographic and phenotypic change. Other studies indicate that diversity at neutral microsatellite loci may be correlated with variability at selected genes, thus compromising a population's subsequent recovery and adaptive potential. Such effects are especially pertinent to North Sea cod, which are threatened by continuing exploitation and rising sea temperatures.",w.f.hutchinson@hull.ac.uk,2003,10.1098/rspb.2003.2493,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,ancient-dna,KF,JW,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,adaptation,,,,marine,Actinopterygii,UnitedKingdom,"FlamboroughHead,SouthernBight,FlamboroughHead,FlamboroughHead,FlamboroughHead,FlamboroughHead","2000.05.01,1998.01.01,1981.01.01,1970.01.01,1960.01.01,1954.01.01","72,72,72,72,72,72",5,1954.01.01,2000.05.01,2738,opportunistic,"anthorpogenic, natural",human_exploitation,climate_change,,acute,microsat,otolith,dried,Hutchinson et al 1999,Pharmacia ALFexpresss automatic sequencer,PCR,microsatellite; Gen time: fishbase,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years natural populations have come under considerable pressure due to overharvesting and ecological shifts. The spatial genetic structure of H. midae has been determined; however there has not been a temporal assessment of abalone population dynamics around the South African coast. Using a population genomics approach this study aimed to assess fluctuations in genetic diversity among wild and cultured South African abalone populations through time and space. Various estimates of genetic diversity and population differentiation were calculated using EST-derived SNP markers. All populations had comparable levels of genetic diversity and the long-term effective population size appears to be sufficiently large for the wild populations, despite evidence of recent bottlenecks. Population differentiation was for the most part geographically correlated, with spatial genetic structure maintained across temporal samples. Significant genetic differentiation was, however, detected among temporal samples taken from the same locality. There was evidence for comparatively small short-term effective population sizes that could explain large changes in allele frequencies due to stochastic effects. Temporal heterogeneity could also be explained by changes in selection pressures over time. H. midae populations could, therefore, be more dynamic than previously estimated and this could have implications for effective conservation and fisheries management.",clintr@sun.ac.za,2017,10.1007/s10592-016-0879-5,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,BR,JW,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,connectivity,adaptation,,marine,Gastropoda,South Africa,"Witsand.Cape Recife.Riet Point,Saldanha Bay,Witsand.Saldanha Bay,Gansbaai.Riet Point,Cape Recife","2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2000.01.01","9.30.32,31,33.48,24.51,19",2,2000.01.01,2011.01.01,2190,pre-designed,"natural, anthropogenic",env_variation,climate_change,human_exploitation,acute,SNP,"muscle,gills",ethanol,CTAB,Illumina-BeadXPress SNP assay,Bead_array,generation time: Rhode et al 2017. ,,,,,,,,,,

Conservation and management of these fishes are of prime importance because the people living around the SCS are highly dependent on these resources. Nevertheless, basic biological information, especially relating to genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and demographic patterns, are often deficient. In this study, population genetic methods were used to investigate the genetic structure and diversity as well as historical demography of four ecologically and economically important small pelagic fishes in the SCS: Auxis thazard (Lacepede, 1800); Bali sardine, Sardinella lemuru (Bleeker, 1853); Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta (Cuvier, 1816); and bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus (Bloch, 1793), Fish samples were collected from 5 geographic locations: (Philippines: Zamboanga, Tawi-Tawi and Palawan; Indonesia: Manado; and Malaysia: Kudat) around the SCS and muscle tissues were sequenced for the mitochondrial DNA (D-loop) control region (n = 150, 231, 169 and 224 for AT, SL, RK, and SC, respectively). Low overall F-ST values, high haplotype diversity but low genetic differentiation among haplotypes, and highly mixed clusters from BAPS analysis indicate no distinct genetic population structuring among the samples. Furthermore, neutrality tests, mismatch analysis and Bayesian skyline plots suggest population expansion for all species. Generally, these results indicate that the four marine pelagic species are very resilient over evolutionary time scales; yet, proper management is very necessary, especially because overexploitation of small pelagic fishes has already been reported in the SCS region.

3367,,Loss of genetic integrity and biological invasions result from stocking and introductions of Barbus barbus: insights from rivers in England,"Antognazza, CM; Andreou, D; Zaccara, S; Britton, RJ","Anthropogenic activities, including the intentional releases of fish for enhancing populations (stocking), are recognized as adversely impacting the adaptive potential of wild populations. Here, the genetic characteristics of European barbel Barbus barbus were investigated using 18 populations in England, where it is indigenous to eastern-flowing rivers and where stocking has been used to enhance these populations. Invasive populations are also present in western-flowing rivers following introductions of translocated fish. Two genetic clusters were evident in the indigenous range, centered on catchments in northeast and southeast England. However, stocking activities, including the release of hatchery-reared fish, have significantly reduced the genetic differentiation across the majority of this range. In addition, in smaller indigenous rivers, populations appeared to mainly comprise fish of hatchery origin. In the nonindigenous range, genetic data largely aligned to historical stocking records, corroborating information that one particular river (Kennet) in southeast England was the original source of most invasive B. barbus in England. It is recommended that these genetic outputs inform management measures to either restore or maintain the original genetic diversity of the indigenous rivers, as this should help ensure populations can maintain their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Where stocking is considered necessary, it is recommended that only broodstock from within the catchment is used.",cm.antognazza@gmail.com,2016,10.1002/ece3.1906,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,KC,BR,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
420,,"Evidence of hidden biodiversity, ongoing speciation and diverse patterns of genetic structure in giant Antarctic amphipods","Baird, HP; Miller, KJ; Stark, JS","Recent molecular research on Antarctic benthic organisms has challenged traditional taxonomic classifications, suggesting that our current perceptions of Antarctic biodiversity and species distributions must be thoroughly revised. Furthermore, genetic differentiation at the intraspecific level remains poorly understood, particularly in eastern Antarctica. We addressed these issues using DNA sequence data for two sibling amphipod species that could be collected on a circum-Antarctic scale: Eusirus perdentatus and Eusirus giganteus. Haplotype networks and Bayesian phylogenies based on mitochondrial (COI, CytB) and nuclear (ITS2) DNA provided strong evidence of multiple cryptic species of Eusirus, with several occurring in sympatry and at least one likely to have a true circum- Antarctic distribution. Within species, gene flow was often highly restricted, consistent with a brooding life history and in some cases suggestive of current or future allopatric speciation. Patterns of genetic structure were not always predictable: one cryptic species showed preliminary evidence of high genetic differentiation across similar to 150 km in eastern Antarctica (F-ST > 0.47, P < 0.01), yet another was remarkably homogenous across similar to 5000 km (F-ST = 0.00, P = 1.00). Genetic diversity also varied among cryptic species, independent of sample size (pi = 0.00-0.99). These results indicate several hidden levels of genetic complexity in these Antarctic amphipods that are neither apparent from previous taxonomic or ecological studies nor predictable from their life history. Such genetic diversity and structure may reflect different modes of survival for Antarctic benthic organisms during historic glacial cycles, and/or subsequent re-establishment of populations on the shelf, and highlight our misunderstanding of Antarctic marine species diversity.",hpbaird@utas.edu.au,2011,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05173.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,museum-dna,JW,BR,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2695,,Multi-year analysis of stock composition of a loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) foraging habitat using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods,"Bass, AL; Epperly, SP; Braun-McNeill, J","Genetic markers have proven useful for determining which sea turtle rookeries contribute to a particular feeding ground. This information is especially relevant when management concerns include anthropogenic mortality of feeding cohorts, and the suspected presence of endangered populations. One such feeding habitat is the Pamlico-Albemarle Estuarine Complex in North Carolina. which was established as an index area in 1995 to monitor population-specific recovery of sea turtles. Pound nets in the study area were surveyed at random from September-December (1995-1997) to enumerate incidental captures of sea turtles as an index of sea turtle abundance. In this study, we estimated the rookery origins of this feeding cohort using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian based stock analysis programs and compare and contrast these different methodologies. The Bayesian methods appear to yield more realistic estimates of percent contribution to the feeding cohort when information regarding relative population sizes was used. Subsequently, we tested for temporal variation in the frequency of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and resulting estimates of contribution over a 3-year time span. Mixed stock analysis of the combined data indicated that 80% of the individuals originated from the south Florida nesting population, 12% were from the northeast Florida to North Carolina nesting population, 6% from Yucatan, Mexico. and 2% from other rookeries. Although statistically significant shifts in haplotype frequencies were not observed between the three annual sampling periods, estimates of composition indicated subtle differences in the contributions to this foraging area over the sampling period.",,2004,10.1007/s10592-004-1979-1,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,BR,BR,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,no,marine,Reptilia,United States,Pamlico-Albemarle Sound,"1997.10.01,1996.10.01,1995.10.01,","156,155,114",3,1995.10.01,1997.10.01,16790,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,blood,lysis buffer (HCl/EDTA),Phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,,,,,,,,,,,

Relocation of wildlife for game management purposes is a widespread practice that may promote the admixing of genetically different populations, subspecies or species. We undertook a large-scale study on the Iberian Peninsula to assess the extent of hybridization in red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa populations, which have been subject to extensive restocking of farm-reared individuals. Using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique to assess the prevalence of individuals with mtDNA from other species, we examined samples of A. rufa from museum specimens (229), extant wild populations (955) and game farms (530). We found widespread occurrence of chukar partridge Alectoris chukar mtDNA lineages in samples obtained from game farm partridges (63% of game farms) and from wild partridges (45% of populations), but no allochthonous mtDNA lineages were found in museum partridges. We also found that the probability of occurrence and the number of partridges with allochthonous lineages was higher in localities where recent restocking had occurred. In addition, investigation of trends in bag records and the numbers of game farms over the past 30 years suggests that the general decline of wild populations has been accompanied by an increase in game farm facilities. These results suggest that supplemental stocking practices are threatening the integrity of the wild population gene pool. We recommend that rural development policies and associated wildlife management programs focused on maintaining high stock densities for hunting also need to consider the impact of game management on the genetic integrity of game populations.",jota.blanco@gmail.com,2008,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00212.x,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,museum-dna,JW,BR,reject,non-genomic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RFLPs,,,,,,,,,,

We compare genetic diversity at the mitochondrial control region today to diversity in archaeological specimens, which represent the populations prior to the regional bounties of the late 1800s to mid-1900s that drastically reduced population sizes and led to local extirpations. We further assess genetic diversity throughout recovery, using biological collections from ongoing long-term studies of both species. Overall, the genetic data are consistent with the historical presence of large, genetically diverse populations of pinnipeds prior to human exploitation, and suggest that gray seals were more dramatically impacted by historical bottlenecks than harbor seals in the Northwest Atlantic. Current mitochondrial diversity in both species is relatively high, and we observe little change over the past several decades during a period of roughly parallel rapid population increases. However, there remain large differences in haplotype composition between pinniped populations of pre-exploitation and today, a lasting genetic signature of historical exploitation that is likely to persist into the future.",kristina.cammen@maine.edu,2018,10.1007/s10592-017-1032-9,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,EG,BR,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,no,marine,Mammalia,United States,NortheasternUS,"2014.01.01,2004.01.01,1995.01.01","39,32,23",3,1995.01.01,2014.01.01,3285,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,,,acute,mtDNA_seq,skin,frozen,Qiagen DNEasy Kit,Sanger,PCR,Harbor seal,,,,,,,,,,
330,,"Long-distance colonization and radiation in gekkonid lizards, Tarentola (Reptilia : Gekkonidae), revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequences","Carranza, S; Arnold, EN; Mateo, JA; Lopez-Jurado, LF","Morphological systematics makes it clear that many non-volant animal groups have undergone extensive transmarine dispersal with subsequent radiation in new often island, areas. However, details of such events are often lacking. Here we use partial DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial cytochrome b and 12S rRNA genes (up to 684 and 320 bp, respectively) to trace migration and speciation in Tarentola geckos, a primarily North African clade which has invaded many of the warmer islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. There were four main invasions of archipelagos presumably by rafting. (i) The subgenus Noetarentola reached Cuba up to 23 million years in (Myr) ago, apparently via the North Equatorial current, a journey of at least 6000 km. (ii) The subgenus Tarentola invaded the eastern Canary Islands relatively recently covering a minimum of 120 km. (iii) The subgenus Makariogecko got to Gran Canaria and the western Canary Islands 7-17.5 Myr ago, either directly from the mainland or via the Selvages or the archipelago of Madeira, an excursion of 200-1200 km. (iv) A single species of Makariogecko from Gomera ol Tenerife in the western Canaries made the 1400 km journey to the Cape Verde Islands up to 7 Myr ago by way of the south-running Canary current. Many journeys have also occurred within archipelagos, a minimum of five taking place in the Canaries and perhaps 16 in the Cape Verde Islands. Occupation of the Cape Verde archipelago first involved an island ill the northern group, perhaps Sao Nicolau, with subsequent spread to its close neighbours. The eastern and southern islands were colonized from these northern islands, at least two invasions widely separated in time being involved. While there are just three allopatric species of Makariogecko in the Canaries, the single invader of the Cape Verde Islands radiated into five, most of the islands being inhabited by two of these which differ in size. While size difference may possibly be a product of character displacement in the northern islands, taxa of different sizes reached the southern islands independently.",ena@nhm.ac.uk,2000,10.1098/rspb.2000.1050,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,historical-dna,JW,BR,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4849,,Phylogeography of the European sturgeon (Acipenser sturio): A critically endangered species,"Chassaing, O; Desse-Berset, N; Hanni, C; Hughes, S; Berrebi, P","The European sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) was once a common species throughout Europe, but the sole remaining natural population presently inhabits the Gironde Estuary in France (Atlantic coast). The species was classified as 'Critically Endangered' in 1996, and the Gironde population is now on the verge of extinction. In this setting, and for the first time, we present the past phylogeographical features of this species throughout Europe along with an assessment of its former genetic diversity. This study was based on a molecular analysis (mtDNA CR sequencing) of 10 living specimens from the Gironde Estuary, 55 museum specimens that had been caught along 19th and 20th centuries, and 59 archaeological remains dating back to 260-5000 years BP, from which mitochondrial DNA was extracted and amplified. Although discontinuous, the produced data provided a realistic image of the former structure of A. sturio in Europe. Reconstruction of the phylogenetic trees and haplotypes network led to the identification of several clades. The mitochondrial genetic diversity of this species was found to be much greater at the core (Iberian Peninsula, Mediterranean and Adriatic regions) than along the margins (Atlantic-Northern Europe, Black Sea) of its range. A series of hypotheses on the dates and causes of changes in the species' major structures are put forward on the basis of these data. Finally, competition with A. oxyrinchus, a sibling species whose presence in Northern Europe was recently reconsidered, is presented as a major factor in the evolution of this species.

483,,Population genetic structure and demographic history of the endemic Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros),"Chen, SF; Rossiter, SJ; Faulkes, CG; Jones, G","Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary processes. Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic uplift, and has been connected to mainland Asia several times since its emergence. A central mountain range runs north to south, bisecting the island, and potentially impedes gene flow along an east-west axis. The Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where it is found mainly at low altitude. To determine the population structure and the demographic and colonization history of this species, we examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203 bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, which decreased from the centre to the south and north. Population differentiation followed a pattern of isolation by distance, though most regional genetic variance was attributable to differences between the relatively isolated southern population and those from other regions. A haplotype network was consistent with these findings and also suggested a southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary contact between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were used to infer a past population expansion predating the last glacial maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R. monoceros formed a monophyletic grouping with respect to its sister taxa. Taken together, our results suggest that this taxon arose from a single period of colonization, and that demographic growth followed in the late Pleistocene. Current genetic structure reflects limited gene flow, probably coupled with stepwise colonization in the past. We consider explanations for the persistence of the species through multiple glacial maxima.",s.j.rossiter@qmul.ac.uk,2006,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02879.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,JW,BR,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9724,,Rare and fleeting: an example of interspecific recombination in animal mitochondrial DNA,"Ciborowski, KL; Consuegra, S; de Leaniz, CG; Beaumont, MA; Wang, JL; Jordan, WC","Recombination is thought to occur only rarely in animal mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA). However, detection of mtDNA recombination requires that cells become heteroplasmic through mutation, intramolecular recombination or ' leakage' of paternal mtDNA. Interspecific hybridization increases the probability of detecting mtDNA recombinants due to higher levels of sequence divergence and potentially higher levels of paternal leakage. During a study of historical variation in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar) mtDNA, an individual with a recombinant haplotype containing sequence from both Atlantic salmon and brown trout ( Salmo trutta) was detected. The individual was not an F1 hybrid but it did have an unusual nuclear genotype which suggested that it was a later-generation backcross. No other similar recombinant haplotype was found from the same population or three neighbouring Atlantic salmon populations in 717 individuals collected during 1948 - 2002. Interspecific recombination may increase mtDNA variability within species and can have implications for phylogenetic studies.",bill.jordan@ioz.ac.uk,2007,10.1098/rsbl.2007.0290,BIOLOGY LETTERS,historical-dna,BR,BR,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"on the fence - surveying from 1940-2000 found one mitochondrial recombination between species.

However, degraded DNA combined with the computational demands of short-read assemblies has posed significant laboratory and bioinformatics challenges for de novo genome assembly. Linked-read or """"synthetic long-read"""" sequencing technologies, such as 10x Genomics, may provide a cost-effective alternative solution to assemble higher quality de novo genomes from degraded tissue samples. Here, we compare assembly quality (e.g., genome contiguity and completeness, presence of orthogroups) between four new deer mouse (Peromyscus spp.) genomes assembled using linked-read technology and four published genomes assembled from a single shotgun library. At a similar price-point, these approaches produce vastly different assemblies, with linked-read assemblies having overall higher contiguity and completeness, measured by larger N50 values and greater number of genes assembled, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we used annotated genes from the four Peromyscus linked-read assemblies and eight additional rodent taxa to generate a phylogeny, which reconstructed the expected relationships among species with 100% support. Although not without caveats, our results suggest that linked-read sequencing approaches are a viable option to build de novo genomes from degraded tissues, which may prove particularly valuable for taxa that are extinct, rare or difficult to collect.",Jocelyn.Colella@unh.edu,2020,10.1111/1755-0998.13155,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,historical-dna,BR,ACS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"accepting this one since they use a new sequencing method on recent (1982-2017) samples so it is relevant, even though they use these for phylogenetics",,,,,,,,,,
4282,,Conservation genetics of an endemic and threatened amphibian (Capensibufo rosei): a leap towards establishing a genetic monitoring framework,"da Silva, JM; Tolley, KA","Given the ever-increasing anthropogenic changes to natural ecosystems, it is imperative that temporal changes in genetic diversity be monitored to help safeguard the future viability of species. Capensibufo rosei is a small, range-restricted bufonid from South Africa, believed to have experienced an enigmatic decline likely due to the suppression of natural fires and the loss of grazing animals from some areas. Without these disturbances, their habitat becomes overgrown, which might affect the characteristics of their breeding pools. Since the 1980s, four breeding sites have been lost, presumably due to loss of breeding habitat through encroachment of vegetation. Currently, there are only two known populations [Cape of Good Hope (CGH) and Silvermine nature reserves] both within Table Mountain National Park. Consequently, this species may be vulnerable to stochastic events and genetic erosion through the loss of metapopulation connectivity. To assess the genetic status of this species, genetic diversity within both populations was quantified for two time periods using 11 microsatellite markers. Despite evidence of severe population bottlenecks, both populations possess levels of diversity similar to other anurans, and Silvermine has greater diversity than CGH. A close examination of the data revealed both populations to be genetically dynamic through time, with the loss and gain of rare alleles. Both populations also experienced a slight increase in overall diversity between sampling periods. While the latter was not statistically significant, the monitoring period was perhaps too short to understand changes in diversity over time. These results will form the baseline for future monitoring to better understand this threatened and declining species and to track genetic erosion or recovery.",jessica.m.dasilva@gmail.com,2018,10.1007/s10592-017-1008-9,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,AAS,ACS,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,no,terrestrial,Amphipoda,Africa,"Silvermine,CapeofGoodHope","2015.01.01, 2011.01.01","22.24, 22.23",2,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,292-730,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,chronic,microsat,toe,ethanol,salt extract,NA,PCR,,,,,,,,,,,

4888,,Predicting population extinctions in Darwin's finches,"Farrington, HL; Lawson, LP; Petren, K","Genetic data are increasingly used for fast, efficient, and cost-effective monitoring of natural populations and assessment of extinction risk in species management. A single modern molecular snapshot is typically used to infer population size and vulnerability, yet for species with unknown and potentially complex genetic metapopulation structure, this technique may not effectively predict vulnerability. Darwin's finches, which are well-represented in museum collections, offer a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of predicting extinction vulnerability in species with complex structure, such as naturally fragmented populations. In this study, we compared ancient DNA from similar to 100year old extinct and extant Darwin's finch populations in the Galapagos Islands to determine whether single time point genetic assessments in the past accurately predicted extinction risk, or if other factors such as metapopulation dynamics could mask population declines. Of eight extinct populations, only one had significantly reduced genetic variation compared to an extant population of similar characteristics. Contrary to our prediction that populations would have decreased genetic diversity prior to extinction when compared to persisting populations, at least one measure of genetic diversity was significantly higher in six of the eight extinct populations when compared to extant populations.

1624,,"Going, going, gone? Loss of genetic diversity in two critically endangered Australian freshwater fishes, Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis and Chlamydogobius squamigenus, from Great Artesian Basin springs at Edgbaston, Queensland, Australia","Faulks, LK; Kerezsy, A; Unmack, PJ; Johnson, JB; Hughes, JM","Artesian springs are particularly sensitive freshwater ecosystems, characterized by specialized flora and fauna which, owing to their isolation, are often endemic. Thus, protection of spring habitats and endemic spring biota is important for biodiversity conservation, particularly because human impacts such as invasive species, habitat destruction, and fragmentation can have such devastating effects. This study investigated the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic diversity and structure of two critically endangered (IUCN) freshwater fish species: red-finned blue-eye Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis, and Edgbaston goby Chlamydogobius squamigenus, with the aim of assisting management agencies to establish relocated populations that conserve the genetic integrity and evolutionary potential of both species. bp from multiple mtDNA genes were amplified from 111 red-finned blue-eye individuals (17 from the 1990s and 94 from 2010), and a 660bp segment of mtDNA cytochrome b was amplified from 111 Edgbaston goby individuals (from 2010). In total, 14 concatenated mtDNA haplotypes were identified in red-finned blue-eye and three cytb haplotypes were identified in Edgbaston goby. Overall assessment of the genetic diversity and structure of the endemic fish fauna from the Edgbaston springs revealed low levels of diversity in both species and a loss of haplotypes in red-finned blue-eye over time. In addition, both species displayed significant genetic structure: at the spring scale for red-finned blue-eye and at the spring group scale for Edgbaston goby. It is concluded that without the appropriate management of relocated populations, such as considering genetic structure and diversity and selecting high quality habitats, these species are at a severe risk of losing evolutionary potential and becoming extinct. This study provides a valuable example for conservation managers of the contribution that population genetic studies can make regarding the adaptive management of endangered species.

3060,,Genetic structure and evolved malaria resistance in Hawaiian honeycreepers,"Foster, JT; Woodworth, BL; Eggert, LE; Hart, PJ; Palmer, D; Duffy, DC; Fleischer, RC","Infectious diseases now threaten wildlife populations worldwide but population recovery following local extinction has rarely been observed. In such a case, do resistant individuals recolonize from a central remnant population, or do they spread from small, perhaps overlooked, populations of resistant individuals? Introduced avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) has devastated low-elevation populations of native birds in Hawaii, but at least one species (Hawaii amakihi, Hemignathus virens) that was greatly reduced at elevations below about 1000 m tolerates malaria and has initiated a remarkable and rapid recovery. We assessed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers from amakihi and two other Hawaiian honeycreepers, apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea), at nine primary study sites from 2001 to 2003 to determine the source of re-establishing birds. In addition, we obtained sequences from tissue from amakihi museum study skins (1898 and 1948-49) to assess temporal changes in allele distributions. We found that amakihi in lowland areas are, and have historically been, differentiated from birds at high elevations and had unique alleles retained through time; that is, their genetic signature was not a subset of the genetic variation at higher elevations. We suggest that high disease pressure rapidly selected for resistance to malaria at low elevation, leaving small pockets of resistant birds, and this resistance spread outward from the scattered remnant populations. Low-elevation amakihi are currently isolated from higher elevations (> 1000 m) where disease emergence and transmission rates appear to vary seasonally and annually. In contrast to results from amakihi, no genetic differentiation between elevations was found in apapane and iiwi, indicating that slight variation in genetic or life-history attributes can determine disease resistance and population recovery. Determining the conditions that allow for the development of resistance to disease is essential to understanding how species evolve resistance across a landscape of varying disease pressures.",jeff.foster@nau.edu,2007,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03550.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,ACS,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,no,terrestrial,Aves,USA,"low,mid,high","2002.01.01,1949.01.01,1898.01.01","135.48.97,6,9",2,1898.01.01,2002.01.01,1216.5,opportunistic,natural,disease,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,toe,dried,Phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,"RC: 2002 represents midpoint of 2001-2003 & 1949 represents midpoint of 1948-1949; low sampled in 1898, mid sampled in 1949, all sampled in 2002; generation time estimated from: http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22720766","phiST,# haplotypes",ARLEQUIN,no,1,,,strong,"low elevation pops are (and have historically been) genetically distinct from high elevation - think low elevation pops were decimated by avian malaria, but some small groups had resistance, and have since helped seed pop growth at low elevations",,

Contrasting results concerning the genetic structure of the species at different geographic scales have been reported. Here, an investigation is made into the population genetic structure of S. aurata along the coast of Italy, using samples analysed previously and material from new sampling sites (12) and using different microsatellite loci (10). One sample from the eastern Atlantic and three temporal replicates from one site were also included. The presence of a weak (overall F(ST) = 0.0072), but significant, genetic population subdivision was detected by F-statistics. Temporal replicates indicate genetic data consistency over time. Isolation by distance between the Atlantic and the coast of Italy is suggested by a Mantel test. The distributional pattern of genetic variance obtained by analysis of molecular variation reflects the geographic sampling areas, but is only partially congruent with the results obtained with fewer sites and loci. The dispersal of passive eggs/larvae by the main currents appears to contribute to shaping the gene flow.

2755,,Genetic and phenotypic variation among geographically isolated populations of the globally threatened Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti,"Garcia, JT; Suarez, F; Garza, V; Calero-Riestra, M; Hernandez, J; Perez-Tris, J","Identifying genetically and phenotypically distinct populations of threatened species is critical if we are to delineate appropriate plans for their conservation. We conducted an integrated analysis of population genetic structure, historical demographic events, current gene flow (all based on mtDNA sequences) and morphological variation of three geographically separated groups of populations of Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti, located in the Iberian Peninsula (three populations), Morocco (two populations), and Tunisia (one population). Unusually, this lark species is the only one among the genus Chersophilus. Our results revealed the early historical divergence of an eastern Dupont's lark lineage (in Tunisia) and a western lineage (in Morocco and Spain), consistent with subspecies taxonomy and distribution. The western lineage subsequently split into two lineages, following the isolation of Iberian and African populations. Such pattern of historical differentiation caused great population genetic structure, with differences among geographic areas explaining more than 80% of total genetic variation. Mismatch distributions and coalescent estimates of divergence time showed that lineage divergence was associated with sudden population expansion events, which apparently took place during the last glaciation, when steppe habitats were widespread across the Mediterranean region. Extant populations from different geographic areas hardly shared any haplotype (only one out of 16 ND2 haplotypes was shared by Tunisian and Moroccan Dupont's larks), and consequently gene flow between geographic areas was found to be virtually absent. Apart from showing great genetic differentiation, Dupont's larks from different geographic areas were morphologically distinct, showing substantial variation in body size and feeding-related traits (length of feet and bill). We conclude that Dupont's lark populations isolated in the Iberian Peninsula, Morocco, and Tunisia are distinct evolutionary entities and should be considered as such in conservation plans. Such circumstance sets a daunting conservation challenge that exemplifies the need of incorporating knowledge of historical processes to our general understanding of the demography of threatened species.

Although we detected two new, rare CR1 haplotypes, genetic diversity remained extremely low. Fully resolved haplotype median network and rarefaction analysis both suggested low probability for further unscreened haplotypes. There was no clear phylogeographic structure across the 12 marine subdivisions covered by the species' range. Haplotypes previously considered diagnostic of the extant North Atlantic and eastern Mediterranean populations had their distributions extended into the western Mediterranean and the North Atlantic, respectively, by both historical and recent samples. Our study suggests that MMS have been genetically depauperate since at least the mid-19th century, and that the massive 1997 die-off in Western Sahara (North Atlantic) could have caused local haplotype extinctions. Our results support the hypothesis of past metapopulation dynamics across the species range, where the current segregation into geographically distant and genetically depauperate breeding populations (i.e., North Atlantic and eastern Mediterranean Sea) derives from the combined effects of historical extinctions, genetic drift on small breeding groups, and persistently low levels of genetic diversity.",philippe.gaubert@univ-tlse3.fr,2019,10.1111/mms.12604,MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE,ancient-dna,ACS,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,no,marine,Mammalia,"Greece,Turkey,Croatia,Morocco,Bulgaria,France,Italy,Algeria,Portugal,Libya,Western Sahara",Mediterranean,"2001.01.01,1904.01.01","16,24",2,1904.01.01,2001.01.01,4088,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,"bone,skin",NA,"DNeasy blood and tissue kit, MinElute PCR Purification kit",Sanger,PCR,"RC: 2001 represents midpoint between 2014 & 1989, 1904 represents midpoint between 1975 & 1833; generation time pulled from https://ruffordorg.s3.amazonaws.com/media/project_reports/19938-1%20Presentation%20-%20Promote%20the%20protection%20of%20monk%20seal%20in%20Albania.pdf","# haplotypes,# polymorphic sites,haplotype diversity,pi",DNAsp,no,1,,,medium,saw slightly higher genetic diversity in historical samples --- although I have questions about sample size/pooling across larger spatial and temporal range,,

In this study we analyse the sequence variation at the mitochondrial control region throughout the species range to infer its recent evolutionary history and to evaluate the current genetic status of the species. This study became possible through the extensive use of museum specimens to study populations now extinct. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of two divergent mitochondrial lineages, lineage A occurring mainly in Western European populations and lineage B in African, Eastern European and Central Asian populations. The relative frequencies of haplotypes belonging to each lineage in the different populations show a steep East-West clinal distribution with maximal mixture of the two lineages in the Alps and Greece populations. A genealogical signature for population growth was found for lineage B, but not for lineage A; futhermore the Clade B haplotypes in western populations and clade A haplo-types in eastern populations are recently derived, as revealed by their peripheral location in median-joining haplotype networks. This phylogeographical pattern suggests allopatric differentiation of the two lineages in separate Mediterranean and African or Asian glacial refugia, followed by range expansion from the latter leading to two secondary contact suture zones in Central Europe and North Africa. High levels of among-population differentiation were observed, although these were not correlated with geographical distance. Due to the marked genetic structure, extinction of Central European populations in the last century re-sulted in the loss of a major portion of the genetic diversity of the species. We also found direct evidence for the effect of drift altering the genetic composition of the remnant Pyrenean population after the demographic bottleneck of the last century. Our results argue for the management of the species as a single population, given the apparent ecological exchangeability of extant stocks, and support the ongoing reintroduction of mixed ancestry birds in the Alps and planned reintroductions in Southern Spain.",godoy@cica.es,2004,10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02075.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,ancient-dna,RC,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RC: reject, no real temporal analyses (mainly phylogeographic and incorporating museum specimens into regional analyses)",,,,,,,,,,

Washington and Jefferson, New Hampshire, USA, and because of its small and declining population size, it is considered threatened. White Mountain arctic adults occur only within four alpine meadows, and it has been suggested that dispersal, and hence gene flow, may be restricted among these meadow subpopulations. Furthermore, although the WMA likely is biennial (i.e., requires 2 years for development) like all other species of Oeneis, adults emerge annually. Thus the WMA population may be further structured into two allochronic cohorts, reproductively isolated by their asynchronous adult emergence in either even- or odd-numbered years. We assessed the spatial (among meadows) and temporal (between even- and odd-year cohorts) genetic structure and diversity of the WMA using mtDNA and AFLP markers generated from non-lethally sampled wing and leg tissue. We found no evidence for restricted gene flow among meadows. AFLPs indicated weak differentiation between alternate year cohorts; however, it remains unclear whether this resulted from allochronic reproductive isolation or genetic drift. Despite the WMA's small population size and isolation, levels of AFLP genetic diversity were generally high. Rather than focusing on factors related to population connectivity and adult dispersal, our results suggest that management efforts for the WMA should instead focus explicitly on factors affecting recruitment and mortality.",agradish@uoguelph.ca,2015,10.1007/s10592-015-0736-y,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,BR,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,no,terrestrial,Insecta,USA,"Cow Pasture,Fulf Tanks,Bigelow Lawn","2012.07.01,2011.07.01","9.8.9,11.12.14",2,2011.07.01,2012.07.01,730,pre-designed,natural,NA,,,NA,mtDNA_seq,"wing,leg",ethanol,Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit,Sanger,PCR,"mtDNA + AFLPs, not much of a temporal analysis; RC: not recording AFLP data, just mtDNA","haplotype diversity,pi,AMOVA","Arlequin,AMOVA",no,1,,,small,"no real change in diversity through time, some change in structure between even & odd cohorts, but don't know main cause of this",,

Captive-born individuals are sometimes used in reintroductions, but the effectiveness of this strategy is poorly understood due to insufficient post-reintroduction monitoring and evaluation. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of using captive-born individuals of an endangered rodent, the Perdido Key beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus trissyllepsis) to reestablish a population on the western end of Perdido Key at Gulf State Park, Alabama, from which it was extirpated in 1997. We released 48 captive-born mice in March 2010 and monitored the population through livetrapping across 8 sessions spanning 5 years. We evaluated temporal changes in microsatellite genetic diversity to determine whether mice born in the wild were derived from released mice. The number of mice declined by 73% to 13 individuals in the first 2 weeks after release but increased to an estimated 206 (95% confidence interval = 195-217) individuals after 5 years. Genetic monitoring demonstrated a slight decrease in diversity during the first 3 months but an increase by year 5. Admixture from a neighboring population was detected in year 2 and year 5, which corresponded to the largest increase in population size between trapping sessions. This change in abundance corresponded with a doubling of Ne/N signifying a possible role of admixture in population growth and resilience. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using captive-born beach mice to reestablish populations when wild populations are too small to serve as donors for a translocation. We could not, however, discern how gene flow from an expanding neighboring population affected growth or persistence of the reintroduced population. Our study emphasizes that in future reintroductions, genetics should be monitored together with demographic patterns, because cryptic gene flow could affect how we interpret reintroduction success.",dgreene907@gmail.com,2017,10.1093/jmammal/gyw229,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,temporal-genetics,BR,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RC: reject bc captive-bred mice (""re-seeding"" locally extirpated pop and following progress)",,,,,,,,,,

Domains II and III of the control region along with part of the 12S gene were sequenced from 38 individuals (956 base pairs in 30 individuals and 430-824 base pairs for an additional 8 individuals sampled from museum specimens), and Domain I was sequenced from five of these birds (400 base pairs). We identified a total of five haplotypes based on four variable sites distributed over Domains II and III of the control region and the 12S gene. An additional variable site was identified in Domain I. All changes were transitions and no more than three sites differed between any two individuals. Variation in the control region of condors was lower than for most other birds analyzed for these loci. Although low genetic variability is often associated with endangered megafauna, the condor example is notable because the species still maintains a substantial geographic range.

We compared archival and contemporary Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) collections from the John Day River in Oregon, USA, to evaluate the temporal relationships among four primary spawning areas over a span of 28 years (1978-2006). Although it lies amid many hatchery-supplemented salmon populations of the Columbia River, the John Day River has itself experienced no directed supplementation. Using a combined panel of 13 microsatellite and 92 single nucleotide polymorphism loci, we observed significant temporal heterogeneity across sample sites and tested for two likely evolutionary influences: stochastic processes (i.e. genetic drift) and gene flow via immigration. Based on abundance and effective population size estimates, we found no evidence indicating a recent bottleneck. We observed a sharp temporal decline in probability of self-assignment of John Day River fish, particularly for the North Fork tributary. There was a corresponding increase in assignment to distant Snake River populations, attributed to accumulating introgression from out-of-basin sources over time.

4313,,"Genetic signatures through space, time and multiple disturbances in a ubiquitous brooding coral","Underwood, JN; Richards, ZT; Miller, KJ; Puotinen, ML; Gilmour, JP","The predominance of self-recruitment in many reef-building corals has fundamental and complex consequences for their genetic diversity, population persistence and responses to climate change. Knowledge of genetic structure over local scales needs to be placed within a broad spatial context, and also integrated with genetic monitoring through time to disentangle these consequences. Here, we examined patterns of genetic diversity over multiple spatio-temporal scales across tropical Australia in the ubiquitous brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix. We also analysed complimentary environmental and demographic data to elucidate the seascape drivers of these patterns. Large genetic differences were detected between the east vs. west coasts of Australia. In northwest Australia, geographic differentiation dominated genetic structure over multiple scales. However, three sympatric lineages were detected at the largest offshore reef system (Scott Reef). Similar to the differences observed among putative species in eastern Australia, these lineages were associated with different levels of wave exposure. Local genetic structure within the Scott Reef system was relatively stable over 10 years, but temporal differences were observed that reflected small but important genetic changes over a few generations during recovery after severe bleaching. These results highlight the importance of self-recruitment together with occasional longer distance connectivity for the persistence of a metapopulation across spatially and temporally variable environments. Our multidimensional research provides a foundation for further long-term genetic monitoring to inform conservation strategies and highlights that sampling scales, ecological effects and cryptic diversity are important considerations to develop realistic understanding of the evolutionary resilience of corals.",j.underwood@aims.gov.au,2018,10.1111/mec.14559,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,museum-dna,RC,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,,marine,Hexacorallia,Australia,"SL1,SL2,SS1,SS3,SS4","2014.01.01,2009.01.01,2004.01.01","31.29.33.29.31,33.31.27,47.49.47.43.46","2,3",2004.01.01,2014.01.01,1460,pre-designed,"anthorpogenic, natural",climate_change,natural_disaster,,acute,microsat,branch tip,ethanol,Qiagen DNeasy Kit,Sanger,PCR,"RC: All sites sampled in 2014, 2009 & 2004 except for SL4 & SS3 (only 2014 & 2004); sample sizes estimated from STRUCTURE plots; generation time pulled from Csaszar et al.

5857,,King penguin population on Macquarie Island recovers ancient DNA diversity after heavy exploitation in historic times,"Heupink, TH; van den Hoff, J; Lambert, DM","Historically, king penguin populations on Macquarie Island have suffered greatly from human exploitation. Two large colonies on the island were drastically reduced to a single small colony as a result of harvesting for the blubber oil industry. However, recent conservation efforts have resulted in the king penguin population expanding in numbers and range to recolonize previous as well as new sites. Ancient DNA methods were used to estimate past genetic diversity and combined with studies of modern populations, we are now able to compare past levels of variation with extant populations on northern Macquarie Island. The ancient and modern populations are closely related and show a similar level of genetic diversity. These results suggest that the king penguin population has recovered past genetic diversity in just 80 years owing to conservation efforts, despite having seen the brink of extinction.",d.lambert@griffith.edu.au,2012,10.1098/rsbl.2012.0053,BIOLOGY LETTERS,ancient-dna,AAS,RC,reject,ancient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc samples actually ancient (>200 years old),,,,,,,,,,

The degraded DNA in historical samples, such as stuffed or excavated specimens, however, is often not suitable for sequence analyses. To address this problem, we developed an amplified product length polymorphism (APLP) analysis for mtDNA-haplogrouping U. arctos specimens by detecting haplogroup-specific SNPs. We verified the validity and utility of this method by analysing up to 170-year-old skin samples from U. arctos specimens collected widely across continental Eurasia. We detected some of the same haplogroups as those occurring in eastern Hokkaido (Japan) and eastern Alaska in continental Eurasia (the Altai and the Caucasus). Our results show that U. arctos in eastern Hokkaido and eastern Alaska descended from a common ancestor in continental Eurasia, and suggest that U. arctos occupied several refugia in southern Asia during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Due to the typically unpredictable nature of such phenomena, however, few studies have been able to directly compare patterns of diversity before and after natural catastrophic events. Here, we examine the impacts of a recent volcanic eruption in southern Chile on genetic variation in the colonial tuco-tuco (Ctenomys sociabilis), a subterranean species of rodent endemic to the area most affected by the June 2011 eruption of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex. To provide a comparative context for interpreting changes in genetic variation in this species, we also analyze the effects of this eruption on genetic variation in the geographically proximate but more widely distributed Patagonian tuco-tuco (C. haigi). Our analyses indicate that while both C. sociabilis and C. haigi displayed significant post-eruption decreases in population density, the apparent impacts of the eruption on genetic diversity differed between species.

To place these findings in a larger spatiotemporal context, we compared our results for C. sociabilis to genetic data from additional modern and ancient populations of this species.

Such knowledge is of particular importance for species restoration, given links between genetic diversity and the probability of long-term persistence. To directly evaluate the relationship between current genetic diversity and past demographic events, we collected genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from prebottleneck historical (c.1906) and postbottleneck contemporary (c.2014) samples of Pinzon giant tortoises (Chelonoidis duncanensis; n = 25 and 149 individuals, respectively) endemic to a single island in the Galapagos. Pinzon giant tortoises had a historically large population size that was reduced to just 150-200 individuals in the mid 20th century. Since then, Pinzon's tortoise population has recovered through an ex situ head-start programme in which eggs or pre-emergent individuals were collected from natural nests on the island, reared ex situ in captivity until they were 4-5 years old and subsequently repatriated. We found that the extent and distribution of genetic variation in the historical and contemporary samples were very similar, with the latter group not exhibiting the characteristic genetic patterns of recent population decline. No population structure was detected either spatially or temporally. We estimated an effective population size (N-e) of 58 (95% CI = 50-69) for the postbottleneck population; no prebottleneck N-e point estimate was attainable (95% CI = 39-infinity) likely due to the sample size being lower than the true N-e.

6669,,Historical specimens reveal past relationships and current conservation status of populations in a declining species: the regal fritillary butterfly,"Keyghobadi, N; Koscinski, D; Weintraub, JD; Fonseca, DM",". 1.The regal fritillary butterfly, Speyeria idalia Drury 1773, was once widespread across eastern North America, but has declined significantly and rapidly over the past half-century. Although more stable in the western portion of its range, only two populations survive east of the Great Lakes, one in eastern Pennsylvania and the other in Virginia. 2.Previous studies have found that the remnant Pennsylvania population is genetically differentiated from populations in the west, and have suggested the designation of separate eastern and western subspecies. However, the historical pattern of genetic variation from which the current distinctness of the Pennsylvania population has arisen was not known, nor was the relationship with the remnant Virginia population. 3.We amplified and sequenced two mitochondrial loci (COI/II and ND4) from preserved specimens to infer historical patterns of genetic variation in this species, and we used non-lethally obtained tissue samples to assess the relationship of the two eastern remnant populations. 4.We found very consistent patterns between the two loci. Both had a very shallow haplotype network with few mutations separating most haplotypes. At both loci, we observed distinct groups of haplotypes in the western and far eastern (i.e. New England) portions of the range; a region of transition was centred on Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and the Virginias, where both groups, and intermediate haplotypes, were represented. 5.Importantly, the extant Virginia population shared haplotypes with western populations of S. idalia and not with the extant Pennsylvania population.

It can reveal genetic diversity and genetic composition changes of declining native populations that are supported through stocking with captive bred individuals. The present study was designed to analyse the temporal stability of a declining common carp (Cyprinus carpio) population from Lake Volvi (North Greece). Polymorphism was evaluated using seven microsatellite loci at two sampling time points (separated by 12 years). The genetic variability of four additional populations (from two rivers and two lakes) in Northern Greece was also investigated for comparison. Heterozygosity values (0.692-0.868) and allelic richness (8.530-11.148) were high for all studied populations and comparable to other European populations. However, the analysis of temporal common carp samples from Lake Volvi revealed a significant change in their genetic composition and admixture analysis demonstrated significant introgression of stocked individuals into the native population. Both temporal and point estimate methods revealed low effective size (Ne = 61-171.3) for this population, possibly a result of an ancient genetic bottleneck that led to population decline and/or recent anthropogenic interventions. This low Ne has rendered the native population vulnerable to alteration of its genetic composition. Our study demonstrates that enhancement programs should be applied cautiously, especially for small populations. Moreover, it underlines the need for temporal analyses, which may contribute to the evaluation of previous management policies and to future decision making.",atriant@bio.auth.gr,2011,10.1007/s10592-011-0231-z,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,AAS,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc temporal replicates from stocked population,,,,,,,,,,
9785,,Demographic and genetic collapses in spatially structured populations: insights from a long-term survey in wild fish metapopulations,"Mathieu-Begne, E; Loot, G; Chevalier, M; Paz-Vinas, I; Blanchet, S","Unraveling the relationship between demographic declines and genetic changes over time is of critical importance to predict the persistence of at-risk populations and to propose efficient conservation plans. This is particularly relevant in spatially structured populations (i.e. metapopulations) in which the spatial arrangement of local populations can modulate both demographic and genetic changes. We used ten-year demo-genetic monitoring to test 1) whether demographic declines were associated with genetic diversity declines and 2) whether the spatial structure of a metapopulation can weaken or reinforce these demographic and genetic temporal trends. We continuously surveyed, over time and across their entire range, two metapopulations of an endemic freshwater fish species Leuciscus burdigalensis: one metapopulation that had experienced a recent demographic decline and a second metapopulation that was stable over time. In the declining metapopulation, the number of alleles rapidly decreased, the inbreeding coefficient increased, and a genetic bottleneck emerged over time. In contrast, genetic indices were constant over time in the stable metapopulation. We further show that, in the declining metapopulation, demographic and genetic declines were not homogeneously distributed across the metapopulation. We notably identify one local population situated downstream as a 'reservoir' of individuals and genetic variability that dampens both the demographic and genetic declines measured at the metapopulation level. We demonstrate the usefulness of long-term monitoring that combines both genetic and demographic parameters to understand and predict temporal population fluctuations of at-risk species living in a metapopulation context.",eglantine.mb@gmail.com,2019,10.1111/oik.05511,OIKOS,temporal-genetics,RC,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,connectivity,,no,freshwater,Actinopterygii,France,"Viaur,Cele","2014.01.01,2013.01.01,2012.01.01,2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01","20.160,32.136,48.176,32.272,64.128,104.136,160.176,112.112,152.120,120",10,2005.01.01,2014.01.01,1095,pre-designed,natural,NA,,,NA,microsat,fin,ethanol,salt extract,Sanger,PCR,"RC: sample size estimated from paper -- know 2264 total dace were genotyped, and each metapop (site) was sampled at ~8 locations each year, pulled average sample size/location from each river/year (figure 2) and back calculated","# of alleles,allelic richness,Fis,He,Ho,M-ratio,Ne,impact of metapopulation structure on diversity loss","adegenet,NeEstimator,GLMMs (glmmADMB package)",no,12,,,strong,"difference in genetic change between declining pop (Viaur) and stable pop (Cele) -- declining pop lost # alleles, increased inbreeding and showed signatures of a bottleneck while stable pop showed no change -- BUT change in declining pop not consistent across space -- one local pop in metapop was a reservoir and maintained more diversity than others --- USEFUL FOR THINKING OF HOW METAPOPS CHANGE THROUGH SPACE AND TIME",,
5957,,Temporal genetic structure in a poecilogonous polychaete: the interplay of developmental mode and environmental stochasticity,"Kesaniemi, JE; Mustonen, M; Bostrom, C; Hansen, BW; Knott, KE","Background: Temporal variation in the genetic structure of populations can be caused by multiple factors, including natural selection, stochastic environmental variation, migration, or genetic drift. In benthic marine species, the developmental mode of larvae may indicate a possibility for temporal genetic variation: species with dispersive planktonic larvae are expected to be more likely to show temporal genetic variation than species with benthic or brooded non-dispersive larvae, due to differences in larval mortality and dispersal ability. We examined temporal genetic structure in populations of Pygospio elegans, a poecilogonous polychaete with within-species variation in developmental mode. P. elegans produces either planktonic, benthic, or intermediate larvae, varying both among and within populations, providing a within-species test of the generality of a relationship between temporal genetic variation and larval developmental mode. Results: In contrast to our expectations, our microsatellite analyses of P. elegans revealed temporal genetic stability in the UK population with planktonic larvae, whereas there was variation indicative of drift in temporal samples of the populations from the Baltic Sea, which have predominantly benthic and intermediate larvae. We also detected temporal variation in relatedness within these populations. A large temporal shift in genetic structure was detected in a population from the Netherlands, having multiple developmental modes. This shift could have been caused by local extiction due to extreme environmental conditions and (re)colonization by planktonic larvae from neighboring populations. Conclusions: In our study of P. elegans, temporal genetic variation appears to be due to not only larval developmental mode, but also the stochastic environment of adults. Large temporal genetic shifts may be more likely in marine intertidal habitats (e.g. North Sea and Wadden Sea) which are more prone to environmental stochasticity than the sub-tidal Baltic habitats. Sub-tidal and/or brackish (less saline) habitats may support smaller P. elegans populations and these may be more susceptible to the effects of random genetic drift. Moreover, higher frequencies of asexual reproduction and the benthic larval developmental mode in these populations leads to higher relatedness and contributes to drift. Our results indicate that a general relationship between larval developmental mode and temporal genetic variation may not exist.",jenni.kesaniemi@jyu.fi,2014,10.1186/1471-2148-14-12,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KJ,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,no,marine,Annelida,"Sweden,Denmark,Netherlands,United Kingdom","Angso,Faro,Vellerup,Rorvig,Hesler,Netherlands,Drum Sands","2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01","42,42.39.43.40.42.46.49,52.40.47.42.48.28,53.45.43.24","2,3",2008.01.01,2010.01.01,182.5,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,acute,microsat,whole,ethanol,Qiagen & Kingfisher magnetic processor,Sanger,PCR,"RC: all sites sampled in 2010, 2009 & 2008 unless otherwise noted (Rorvig & Drum Sands only 2010 & 2009, Hersler only 2010 & 2008, Netherlands only 2011,2010 & 2009); generation time given as 2x per year BUT Angso/Faro were suggested as only 1 generation per site","He,Ho,allelic richness,# private alleles, Fis,AMOVA,pair-wise Fst,STRUCTURE,sibship,relatedness,Ne,genetic drift (estimated)","Arlequin,HP-RARE,FSTAT,AMOVA,DEMEtics,GenAlEx,STRUCTURE,COLONY,ML-Relate,NeEstimator,TempoFs",no,8,,,medium,UK population had temporal stability (mostly planktonic larvae) but other sites with benthic/intermediate larvae had temporal structure -- perhaps from local extirpation/recolonization,,

Pairwise I broken vertical bar st analysis and AMOVA clearly showed minimal population structure and haplotype network did not reveal any clear geographic pattern in Lake Biwa. It is probable that strays spawn in non-natal spawning areas, resulting in significant levels of gene flow among spawning areas. Genetic characteristics of hatchery stock F1, F2, and F3 were similar to those of wild samples in terms of haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity and pairwise I broken vertical bar st values.

From the results of a temporary site-vacancy of adult chameleons during the study, we anticipated a significant shift in microsatellite allele frequencies. Using data from eight highly polymorphic loci we detected differences in the allelic composition of chameleons inhabiting the study site between pre- and post-site-vacancy periods (AMOVA R-ST = 0.017; P = 0.019). Results suggest that recolonisation by immigrant chameleons, from an adjacent vegetation fragment connected to the study site by corridors, caused the recorded shifts in allelic frequencies.

249,,Phenotypic and genetic diversity in aposematic Malagasy poison frogs (genus Mantella),"Klonoski, K; Bi, K; Rosenblum, EB","Intraspecific color variation has long fascinated evolutionary biologists. In species with bright warning coloration, phenotypic diversity is particularly compelling because many factors, including natural and sexual selection, contribute to intraspecific variation. To better understand the causes of dramatic phenotypic variation in Malagasy poison frogs, we quantified genetic structure and color and pattern variation across three closely related species, Mantella aurantiaca, Mantella crocea, and Mantella milotympanum. Although our restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing approach identified clear genetic clusters, they do not align with current species designations, which has important conservation implications for these imperiled frogs. Moreover, our results suggest that levels of intraspecific color variation within this group have been overestimated, while species diversity has been underestimated. Within major genetic clusters, we observed distinct patterns of variation including: populations that are phenotypically similar yet genetically distinct, populations where phenotypic and genetic breaks coincide, and populations that are genetically similar but have high levels of within-population phenotypic variation. We also detected admixture between two of the major genetic clusters. Our study suggests that several mechanisms-including hybridization, selection, and drift-are contributing to phenotypic diversity.

2581,,"Testing metapopulation dynamics using genetic, demographic and ecological data","Lamy, T; Pointier, JP; Jarne, P; David, P","The metapopulation concept is a cornerstone in the recent history of ecology and evolution. However, determining whether a natural system fits a metapopulation model is a complex issue. Extinction-colonization dynamics are indeed often difficult to quantify because species detectability is not always 100%, resulting in an imperfect record of extinctions. Here, we explore whether combining population genetics with demographic and ecological surveys can yield more realistic estimates of metapopulation dynamics. We apply this approach to the freshwater snail Drepanotrema depressissimum in a fragmented landscape of tropical ponds. In addition to studying correlations between genetic diversity and demographical or ecological characteristics, we undertake, for the first time, a detailed search for genetic signatures of extinctionrecolonization events using temporal changes in allele frequencies within sites. Surprisingly, genetic data indicate that extinction is much rarer than suggested by demographic surveys. Consequently, this system is better described as a set of populations with different sizes and immigration rates than as a true metapopulation.

1190,,Molecular characterization of a parasitic tapeworm (Ligula) based on DNA sequences from formalin-fixed specimens,"Li, JJ; Liao, XH; Yang, H","Museum specimens of Ligula (Pseudophyllidea, Ligulidae), a fish parasite tape-worm, that have been preserved in ethanol or fixed permanently in formalin up to 24 years were used for DNA extraction and molecular characterization. DNA was amplified via PCR from samples collected from different fish hosts that lived in both salt and fresh water bodies in the Chinese Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Russia, and England. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial nucleotide sequences of the 5'-end of nuclear 28S rRNA gene and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene support the morphologically based taxonomy that groups the Chinese Ligula within the same species as their Europe counterpart: Lingula intestinalis. No nucleotide variation was detected in either the 28S rRNA gene or the COI gene among the seven plerocercoid samples, suggesting a considerable genetic homogeneity among Ligula from different regions. Our results show that geographic isolation, affinity of hosts, and host habitats are not reliable taxonomic criteria for Ligula classification. Our data also indicate a low genetic diversity in the Ligula prevalent DNA from specimens that were subjected to permanent formalin fixation can be routinely amplified from parasitic tape-worms, suggesting that fixation time in formalin may not be a critical factor affecting DNA degradation in such museum specimens.",hyang@bryant.edu,2000,10.1023/A:1002009117626,BIOCHEMICAL GENETICS,ancient-dna,RC,RC,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no real temporal comparison -- historical samples used for phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,

In reverse, the study of genetic structure between landrace populations can reveal the effects of these forces over time. We present here the analysis of genetic diversity in 40 Swedish field pea (Pisum sativum L.) populations, either available as historical seed samples from the late nineteenth century or as extant gene bank accessions assembled in the late twentieth century. The historical material shows constant high levels of within-population diversity, whereas the extant accessions show varying, and overall lower, levels of within-population diversity. Structure and principal component analysis cluster most accessions, both extant and historical, in groups after geographical origin. County-wise analyses of the accessions show that the genetic diversity of the historical accessions is largely overlapping. In contrast, most extant accessions show signs of genetic drift. They harbor a subset of the alleles found in the historical accessions and are more differentiated from each other. These results reflect how, historically present metapopulations have been preserved during the twentieth century, although as genetically isolated populations.

3964,,Genetic Management of Captive and Reintroduced Bilby Populations,"Lott, MJ; Wright, BR; Kemp, LF; Johnson, RN; Hogg, CJ","Captive breeding and translocation, whereby selected individuals are used to supplement or re-establish failing populations, are powerful tools for conserving threatened fauna. These tools, however, are rarely successful at establishing self-sustaining populations that can survive without ongoing human assistance. The maintenance of genetic diversity and demographic security in captivity, or following wildlife translocation events, is important for improving the long-term effectiveness of threatened species recovery efforts around the world. Routine population monitoring using hypervariable genetic markers represents a promising technique for evaluating the effect of established management practices on population structure and genetic diversity across various spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we employed a data set of 1,068 single nucleotide polymorphisms to conduct a comprehensive survey of population structure and genetic diversity in greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) held at 13 zoos and wildlife sanctuaries across Australia between August 1996 and December 2016. We observed significant genetic structuring across the study sites, consistent with the limited exchange of animals between independently managed facilities. The majority of variation, however, still occurred at the level of individual bilbies (75%, P < 0.001). We also uncovered evidence for an ongoing loss of genetic diversity in some conservation-fenced populations, despite a slight excess of heterozygosity across the sampling sites as a whole. Maintaining the genetic health of bilbies in captivity or following translocation will therefore require stakeholders to focus on reducing individual mortality, and maintaining genetic connectivity across all existing populations through the regular exchange of selected individuals. As such, admixture is expected to play an increasingly important role in future conservation programs. (c) 2019 The Authors.

They are thought to represent native Danish squirrel types and are presently under threat from admixture with introduced red squirrels. In response, a conservation program was started in 2009 that involves the translocation of melanistic squirrels from Funen to the squirrel-free island of Langeland. Using mitochondrial DNA of 101 historical and modern samples from throughout Denmark, we assess for the first time population structure and mitochondrial genetic diversity of Danish squirrels compared to its larger pan-Eurasian distribution. We find that Danish squirrels have low levels of genetic diversity, especially melanistic individuals. Bayesian skyline reconstructions show that Danish squirrels have most probably experienced a severe bottleneck within the last 200 years. Also, fine-scale genetic structure was found between squirrels from the regions of Funen, Zealand and Jutland, which mimics the insular geography of Denmark. Additional nuclear DNA analyses will be required to determine the precise admixture levels between original Danish and introduced squirrels and to locate unmixed candidate populations for specific conservation efforts.",ruth@mayaproject.org; lorlando@snm.ku.dk,2015,10.1093/jhered/esv074,JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,ancient-dna,RC,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no temporal comparison,,,,,,,,,,
6472,,Evidence for isolation by time in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.),"Maes, GE; Pujolar, JM; Hellemans, B; Volckaert, FAM","Life history traits of highly vagile marine species, such as adult reproductive success and larval dispersal, are strongly determined by oceanographic and climatic forces. Nevertheless, marine organisms may show restricted dispersal in time and space. Patterns of isolation by distance (IBD) have been repeatedly observed in marine species. If spawning time is a function of geographical location, temporal and spatial isolation, can easily be confounded or misinterpreted. In this study, we aimed at discriminating between various forces shaping the genetic composition of recruiting juveniles of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.). By controlling for geographical variation, we assessed temporal variation and tested for possible isolation by time (IBT) between recruitment waves within and between years. Using 12 polymorphic allozyme and six variable microsatellite loci, we show that genetic differentiation was low (F-ST = 0.01-0.002) and significant between temporal samples. Regression analysis between genetic and temporal distance, was consistent with a subtle interannual pattern of IBT. Our data suggest that the population dynamics of the European eel may be governed by a double pattern of temporal variance in genetic composition: (i) a broad-scale IBT of spawning cohorts, possibly as a consequence of the large migration loop in anguillids and strong variance in annual adult reproductive contribution; and (ii) a smaller-scale variance in reproductive success (genetic patchiness) within cohorts among seasonally separated spawning groups, most likely originating from fluctuating oceanic and climatic forces. The consistency of both mechanisms remains to be verified with fine-scale analyses of both spawning/migrating aged adults and their offspring to confirm the stochastic/deterministic nature of the IBT pattern in eel.",gregory.maes@bio.kuleuven.be,2006,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02925.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KC,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,,other,Actinopterygii,"Iceland,Ireland,Netherlands,France,Morocco","Vogslaeker,Burrishoole,Den Oever,Loire estuary,Tour du Valat,Oved Sebou","2003.06.01,2003.04.01,2003.04.01,2003.03.01,2002.07.01,2002.05.01,2002.03.01,2002.02.01,2002.01.01,2001.07.01,2001.06.01,2001.04.01,2001.01.01,1999.05.01","52,60,60,60.60,60,60.60,60,60,60,60,60.60,60,60,60","2,3",1999.05.01,2001.05.01,3248.5,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,microsat,"fin,muscle","ethanol, frozen",chelex,Sanger,PCR,"Vogslaeker sampled in 6.2003, 7.2002, & 7.2001, Burrishoole sampled in 4.2003, 3.2002 & 6.2001, Den Oever sampled in 5.2003, 5.2002 & 6.2001, Loire estuary sampled in 3.20003, 1.2002 & 4.2001, Tour du Valat sampled in 3.2003, 2.2002 & 1.2001, Oved Sebou sampled in 5.2001 & 5.1999; generation time pulled from: https://www.fishbase.de/summary/35","polymorphism level,Ho,He,allelic richness,Fis,F-statistics,AMOVA","Genetix,FSTAT,Arlequin",no,6,,,medium,mostly looking at how temporal variation (sweepstakes reproduction) can influence geographic patterns -- found that temporal variation greatly exceeded geographic variation (support for panmixia),,

Stocking can homogenize population structure, impede local adaptation, and hinder the use of genetic stock identification as a fishery management tool. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we evaluate the spatiotemporal genetic structure of 16 anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations in Maine, USA, to determine whether inter-basin stocking practices have influenced population structure and the genetic diversity of the species in this region. Although, no pre-supplementation samples exist, comparative analyses of stocked and non-stocked populations show that stock transfers have influenced alewife population genetic structure. Genetic isolation by distance (IBD) was non-significant among stocked populations, but significant among non-stocked populations. However, two populations, Dresden Mills and Sewell Pond, appear to have resisted genetic homogenization despite stocking. Non-significant genic and genetic differentiations were broadly distributed among alewife populations. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated highly significant differentiation among temporal replicates within populations, and Bayesian clustering analysis revealed weak population structure. A significant correlation was observed between stocking (time and events) and pairwise among alewife collections, and an analysis of IBD residuals showed a significant decline in the amount of genetic differentiation among populations as the extent of stocking activity increased. These findings call for an increased awareness of evolutionary processes and genetic consequences of restoration activities such as inter-basin stock transfers by fisheries management and conservation practitioners.",megsmcbride@gmail.com,2015,10.1007/s10592-015-0733-1,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,BR,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,,other,Actinopterygii,USA,"Orland Dam,Veazie Dam,Souadabscook Falls,Nequasset Lake Dam","2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01","53.52.61.43,60.52.60.60,71.60.59","2,3",2009.01.01,2011.01.01,547.5,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,,chronic,microsat,fin,ethanol,Elphinstone et al. 2003,Sanger,PCR,Orland Dam only sampled in 2010 & 2011; generation time pulled from Palkovacs 2007 Mol.

Genetic monitoring of associated wildlife provides valuable data to support their conservation. Waterbirds such as the wood stork (Mycteria americana) are good bioindicators of wetland disturbance and destruction. This study investigated past and contemporary levels of genetic diversity, differentiation and demographic processes in 236 wood storks from two major wetlands in Brazil in which breeding colonies are concentrated, using nine microsatellite loci and a 237-bp untranslated fragment of the mitochondrial Control Region. Amapa populations (northern region) showed slightly higher levels of genetic diversity than Pantanal populations (central western region) and both populations had a low number of effective breeders. Results from assignment tests, F-statistics, AMOVA, spatial and non-spatial Bayesian clustering analyses support the hypothesis of gene flow among colonies within regions, but significant differentiation between regions. The better supported Bayesian coalescent models based on both markers indicated that the northern population exchanged migrants with unsampled populations, and that the central western population was founded by individuals from the north. Mitochondrial estimates revealed that the timing of population divergence broadly overlapped the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and that the central western population expanded more recently than the northern population. The results support the hypothesis that the coastal wetlands in northern Brazil remained stable enough to shelter large wood stork populations during the LGM and storks colonized freshwater wetlands in the central western region following deglacial warming. Conservation policies and protective measures should consider Amapa and Pantanal wood stork populations as genetically differentiated units and priority should be given to Amapa populations that represent the source gene pool. Continuous genetic monitoring of wood storks would help detect genetic signs of changes in demographic trends that may reflect alterations or degradation in wetlands.",carolinamino@conicet.gov.ar,2017,10.1002/aqc.2791,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,historical-dna,KJ,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no temporal comparison,,,,,,,,,,
733,,Genetic impacts of conservation management actions in a critically endangered parrot species,"Morrison, CE; Johnson, RN; Grueber, CE; Hogg, CJ","Establishing populations of endangered species in captivity is becoming an increasingly common component of species recovery programs for insurance against extinction, and/or for reintroductions. It is important for the success of these efforts that captive populations are genetically representative of wild source populations, and that genetic diversity is maintained over time. Our study presents SNP data from wild and captive populations of the critically endangered Australian orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster). We examine the genetic effects of a decision made in the 2010/2011 breeding season to recruit half of the juvenile cohort (n = 21), from a wild population in decline, to supplement an existing captive program. We report that heterozygosity among wild birds decreased in the years after this action. Following multiple releases of captive-reared birds back into the wild (occurring annually since 2013), captive and wild populations have attained similar overall levels of heterozygosity, and genetic differentiation between these populations is low. Parentage analyses confirm that captive-bred released individuals have successfully paired with wild birds and produced offspring. Our study suggests that translocation of wild individuals into captivity, from wild populations in decline, can potentially have deleterious lasting impacts on genetic diversity levels in these populations. However, our data also confirm that in captivity, founder diversity can be successfully preserved over time, and addition of wild founders can improve captive population health. The genetic diversity retained in captive populations can also be reintroduced to wild populations at a later date, provided that captive-release individuals are able to reproductively contribute to their recipient population.",carolyn.hogg@sydney.edu.au,2020,10.1007/s10592-020-01292-4,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,BR,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Aves,Australia,Australia,"2016.01.01,2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,2011.01.01","28,15,26,4,16",5,2011.01.01,2016.01.01,730,pre-designed,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,invasive_species,,chronic,SNP,blood,"dry,Queen's lysis buffer","Bioline Isolate II genomic DNA kit,Chelex",Illumina_HiSeq,DArTseq,"2011 represents 2011-2012, 2013 represents 2013-2014, 2014 represents 2014-2015, 2015 represents 2015-2016, 2016 represents 2016-2017; generation time pulled from Garnett & Crowley (2000) The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000","internal relatedness,Ho,He,PCoA,Fst","GENHET (R),adegenet,StAMPP (R)",,7768,,,medium,"comparing wild pops before and after individuals taken to supplement captive breeding programs -- found year after indv taken, saw decrease in diversity BUT this increased over time (esp as captive-bred individuals were released back into wild)",,

The Eurasian lynx, for instance, has been actively reintroduced in different regions. Genetic diversity is quickly eroding in these isolated, small populations, questioning the long-term success of lynx reintroductions. To track population development and genetic diversity in a reintroduced lynx population, we used microsatellite analysis and mtDNA haplotyping based on 379 samples collected during the initial 15 year period of lynx reintroduction in the Harz mountains National Park, Germany. The Harz lynx population shows higher genetic diversity relative to other lynx reintroductions, due to initial cross-breeding of divergent captive source lineages and a comparably high founder size. While the population shows significant population growth and spread into adjacent regions, genetic diversity is continiously declining. Expected heterozygosity values dropped from 0.63 after reintroduction (2006/2007) to 0.55 within a 10 year period. Despite this, the Harz lynx population is currently a viable component to an envisioned lynx metapopulation spanning across Central Europe. The ongoing genetic erosion in the Harz population along with a lack of geneflow from adjacent populations indicates that such connectivity is urgently needed to ensure long-term population persistence.",sarah.mueller@senckenberg.de,2020,10.1007/s10592-020-01270-w,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,KF,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc non-wildlife (looking at captive release/reintroduced individuals),,,,,,,,,,

However, often limited effort has been made to evaluate and optimize extraction methods, which may be crucial for downstream applications. Here, we assessed and optimized the usefulness of abundant archived skeletal material from sharks as a source of DNA for temporal genomic studies. Six different methods for DNA extraction, encompassing two different commercial kits and three different protocols, were applied to material, so-called bio-swarf, from contemporary and archived jaws and vertebrae of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). Protocols were compared for DNA yield and quality using a qPCR approach. For jaw swarf, all methods provided relatively high DNA yield and quality, while large differences in yield between protocols were observed for vertebrae. Similar results were obtained from samples of white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Application of the optimized methods to 38 museum and private angler trophy specimens dating back to 1912 yielded sufficient DNA for downstream genomic analysis for 68% of the samples. No clear relationships between age of samples, DNA quality and quantity were observed, likely reflecting different preparation and storage methods for the trophies. Trial sequencing of DNA capture genomic libraries using 20000 baits revealed that a significant proportion of captured sequences were derived from tiger sharks. This study demonstrates that archived shark jaws and vertebrae are potential high-yield sources of DNA for genomic-scale analysis. It also highlights that even for similar tissue types, a careful evaluation of extraction protocols can vastly improve DNA yield.",een@aqua.dtu.dk,2017,10.1111/1755-0998.12580,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,ancient-dna,KF,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no actual temporal comparisons (just looking at best practices for extracting DNA from historical samples),,,,,,,,,,

A powerful approach to assess patterns and processes of genetic erosion is via ancient DNA techniques. Herein, we analyzed mtDNA from historical samples (1800s to present) of Andean Condors (Vultur gryphus) to investigate whether contemporary low genetic variability is the result of recent human expansion and persecution, and compared this genetic history to that of California condors (Gymnogyps californianus).We then explored historic demographies for both species via coalescent simulations. We found that Andean condors have lost at least 17% of their genetic variation in the early 20th century. Unlike California condors, however, low mtDNA diversity in the Andean condor was mostly ancient, before European arrival. However, we found that both condor species shared similar demographies in that population bottlenecks were recent and co-occurred with the introduction of livestock to the Americas and the global collapse of marine mammals. Given the combined information on genetic and demographic processes, we suggest that the protection of key habitats should be targeted for conserving extant genetic diversity and facilitate the natural recolonization of lost territories, while nuclear genomic data should be used to inform translocation plans.",padrojulian@gmail.com,2020,10.1002/ece3.6887,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ancient-dna,JW,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Aves,"Argentina,Venezuela,Chile,Ecuador,Peru,Colombia,Bolivia",South America,"1987.01.01,1915.01.01","38,35",2,1915.01.01,1987.01.01,2555,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,"feather,toe,skin,bone",NA,QIAamp kit,Sanger,PCR,"1987 represents 1961-2013, 1915 represents 1884-1946 (historical samples occurred before/during decline & range contraction in Andean condors & don't contain any individuals that could be alive today)","Hd,pi,average # nucleotide differences,genetic difference between time periods,Mantel test,test for bottlenecks","DNAsP,ARLEQUIN,adegenet (R),DYABC",,2,,,medium,lost ~17% of diversity but low diversity predates human impact (unlike Californian condors); still see evidence for recent bottleneck that co-occured with introduction of livestock,,

A fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was sequenced for 291 colonies of one population in Plymouth, UK, which was monitored for 9 yr after its initial discovery. A total of 238 colonies from 12 localities were also sequenced for population structure analyses. The temporal monitoring of the Plymouth population showed a progressive loss of genetic diversity over time attributable to a strong initial bottleneck followed by genetic drift and/or selection. Population genetic structure was consistent with the historical records of this introduction, which probably originated from oyster farming activities in France, from where the species spread to the UK and Spain. Only one population in France displayed high levels of genetic diversity, and most of the remaining populations presented very low variability. In addition, significant differentiation in terms of allele frequencies was detected between some populations. P. japonica has suffered a loss of genetic diversity in both space and time since its introduction, but this did not prevent its expansion.

Here, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of 1428 Atlantic salmon sampled from 1965 to 2006 in 25 populations throughout France to investigate the influence of stocking on the neutral genetic structure in wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations. On the basis of the analysis of 11 microsatellite loci, we found that the overall genetic structure among populations dramatically decreased over the period studied. Admixture rates among populations were highly variable, ranging from a nearly undetectable contribution from donor stocks to total replacement of the native gene pool, suggesting extremely variable impacts of stocking. Depending on population, admixture rates either increased, remained stable, or decreased in samples collected between 1998 and 2006 compared to samples from 1965 to 1987, suggesting either rising, long-lasting or short-term impacts of stocking. We discuss the potential mechanisms contributing to this variability, including the reduced fitness of stocked fish and persistence of wild locally adapted individuals.",charles5perrier@gmail.com,2013,10.1002/ece3.629,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,temporal-genetics,KC,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc stocked populations,,,,,,,,,,
821,,Loss of genetic diversity in the endemic Hector's dolphin due to fisheries-related mortality,"Pichler, FB; Baker, CS","The endemic New Zealand Hector's dolphin is considered the rarest species of marine dolphin with a total abundance of less than 4000. The species is listed as vulnerable because of fisheries-related mortality due to entanglement in set nets. The vulnerability of this species is further increased by its fidelity to local natal ranges and the genetic isolation of regional populations. Here we present evidence, based on 108 contemporary samples and 55 historical samples dating back to 1870, of a significant loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity in two regional populations of Hector's dolphin. The haplotype diversity (h) was calculated from sequences of a 206 bp fragment in the mtDNA control region, designed to identify 13 out of the 14 known maternal lineages. Over the last 20 years, the North Island population has been reduced from at least three lineages (h = 0.41) to a single lineage (h = 0; P < 0.05). Given its small size, reproductive isolation and reduced genetic diversity, this population is likely to become extinct. The diversity of the East Coast South Island population has declined significantly from h = 0.65 to h = 0.35 (p < 0.05). Based on trend analysis of the mtDNA diversity, we predict that the East Coast population will lose all mtDNA diversity within the next 20 years.

Within estuaries, genotype frequencies may reflect past hybridisation events, with genetically intermediate and backcrossed individuals contributing to persistent hybrid swarms. In southeastern Australia, hybridisation has occurred between estuarine black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri and marine yellowfin bream A. australis, but it is unclear whether this reflects a contemporary process. We recently found that, within lakes and lagoons at the southern range limit of A. australis, hybrids were abundant and A. butcheri extremely rare, and surprisingly, we detected hybrids within a small sample of fish from the Gippsland Lakes, an estuary 250 km further south. In the present study, we compare the genotypic composition of the contemporary Gippsland Lakes population of Acanthopagrus spp. with the historical composition revealed by analysis of museum specimens. The genetic makeup of samples varied little over time, with ancestral A. butcheri virtually absent, and most introgressed individuals matching expectation for later-generation hybrids or A. butcheri backcrosses, suggesting that the lakes have supported persistent hybrid swarms. At each sampling time, the samples were genetically diverse, as measured by mean number of alleles per locus, which ranged from 8.2 to 9.2, and expected heterozygosity (He), which ranged from 0.66 to 0.70; however, we detected little allelic differentiation (F-ST = 0.003) across sampling times.

Insight into these processes is now achieved by analyses of genetic diversity allowing the past and present condition of populations to be assessed and compared. Given its severe fragmentation and small size, the population of the Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus in Poland can be regarded as especially prone to gene-pool alteration. Moreover, this is a region of Europe in which different genetic lineages of the Capercaillie may be present, ensuring that certain conservation decisions may be even more difficult than they otherwise would be. Bearing the above in mind, we decided to study polymorphism of the mitochondrial DNA Control Region (mtDNA CR) in remnant and extinct populations of the Capercaillie in Poland. The extinct population was represented by samples from birds hunted in the Lower Silesian Forest (SW Poland) between 1951-1962. We compared sequences obtained with data from the large, continuous population present in Russia and Scandinavia. Analysing 331 bp of mtDNA CR for 168 individuals, we identified 24 haplotypes, among which only 6 had not been reported previously in the species according to GenBank. Our data confirmed a previous suggestion regarding the genetic structure of the species in Poland, i.e. that birds from Augustow Forest (NE Poland) are related to Russian and Scandinavian populations, constituting a part of the lowland group within the boreal lineage. The Carpathian population is in turn confirmed as an independent genetic group within the boreal lineage, while specimens from the Solska Forest (SE Poland) prove to be highly differentiated from birds in other Polish populations; most likely because they derive from or have been connected via gene flow with - birds present in the Balkans. Further genetic analysis is necessary to resolve this evolutionary relationship between Capercaillies from south-eastern Poland and those of the Balkans. Where practice is concerned, the overall advice is that three Conservation Units are to be recognised in Poland. In addition to those, the extinct population from the Lower Silesian Forest has been deemed part of the lowland group within the boreal lineage, albeit a distinctive one, given the possibility of gene exchange with Carpathian birds. We further suggest that some aspect of this extinct population's genetic diversity reflects an uncontrolled process of reintroduction taking place in the past.",robertrut@miiz.waw.pl,2017,10.3161/00016454AO2017.52.2.006,ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA,historical-dna,BR,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,popsize,,,terrestrial,Aves,Poland,Lower Silesian Forest,"2003.01.01,1955.01.01","5,10",2,1955.01.01,2003.01.01,2336,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,human_exploitation,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,feather,dried,Sherlock AX kit,Sanger,PCR,1955 represents 1950-1960; generation time pulled from: http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/western-capercaillie-tetrao-urogallus/details,"# haplotypes,Hd,pi,mean number of nucleotide differences,theta,AMOVA,Fu's Fs,Tajima's D","DNAsp,Arlequin",,1,,,small,some change in genetic diversity/composition over time but difficult to tell bc low sample sizes (and didn't do much to account for that) - mostly a spatial analysis w/sites not reported here,,

Behavioural data indicate that, unlike other suboscine passerines, the three-wattled bellbird Procnias tricarunculata (Cotingidae) is capable of vocal learning. Procnias tricarunculata shows conspicuous vocal ontogeny, striking geographical variation in song, and rapid temporal change in song within a population. Deprivation studies of vocal development in P. tricarunculata are impractical. Here, we report evidence from mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci that genetic variation within and among the four allopatric breeding populations of P. tricarunculata is not congruent with variation in vocal behaviour. Sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region document extensive haplotype sharing among localities and song types, and no phylogenetic resolution of geographical populations or behavioural groups. The vocally differentiated, allopatric breeding populations of P. tricarunculata are only weakly genetically differentiated populations, and are not distinct taxa. Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite variation show small (2.9% and 13.5%, respectively) but significant correlation with geographical distance, but no significant residual variation by song type. Estimates of the strength of selection that would be needed to maintain the observed geographical pattern in vocal differentiation if songs were genetically based are unreasonably high, further discrediting the hypothesis of a genetic origin of vocal variation. These data support a fourth, phylogenetically independent origin of avian vocal learning in Procnias.

The results indicated that treatment of tissues in buffered solutions at neutral pH and about 37 degrees C for at least four days improves the quality and quantity of extracted DNA and the quality of the amplification and sequencing products. However, the comparison between the performance of DNA obtained from fixed and fresh tissues showed that, in spite of the fact that both types of tissue generate reliable sequences for use in phylogenetic analyses, DNA samples from fixed tissues presented a larger rate of errors in the different stages of the study.

However, using contemporary genetic data to infer the dynamics of genetic diversity may be at risk of a bias, as inferences are performed from a set of extant populations, setting aside unavailable, rare, or now extinct lineages. Here, we took advantage of new developments in next-generation sequencing to analyze the spatial and temporal genetic dynamics of the grasshopper Oedaleus decorus, a steppic Southwestern-Palearctic species. We applied a recently developed hybridization capture (hyRAD) protocol that allows retrieving orthologous sequences even from degraded DNA characteristic of museum specimens. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in 68 historical and 51 modern samples in order to (i) unravel the spatial genetic structure across part of the species distribution and (ii) assess the loss of genetic diversity over the past century in Swiss populations. Our results revealed (i) the presence of three potential glacial refugia spread across the European continent and converging spatially in the Alpine area. In addition, and despite a limited population sample size, our results indicate (ii) a loss of allelic richness in contemporary Swiss populations compared to historical populations, whereas levels of expected heterozygosities were not significantly different. This observation is compatible with an increase in the bottleneck magnitude experienced by central European populations of O.decorus following human-mediated land-use change impacting steppic habitats.

The lifespan of Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri) exceeds 80years, and human impacts on breeding habitat over the last half century may have impeded recruitment, leaving populations dominated by old postreproductive individuals, potentially resulting in a small and declining breeding population. Here, we conduct a single-sample evaluation of genetic erosion within contemporary populations of the Australian lungfish. Genetic erosion is a temporal decline in intraspecific diversity due to factors such as reduced population size and inbreeding. We examined whether young individuals showed signs of reduced genetic diversity and/or inbreeding using a novel bomb radiocarbon dating method to age lungfish nonlethally, based on C-14 ratios of scales. A total of 15,201 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci were genotyped in 92 individuals ranging in age from 2 to 77years old. Standardized individual heterozygosity and individual inbreeding coefficients varied widely within and between riverine populations, but neither was associated with age, so perceived problems with recruitment have not translated into genetic erosion that could be considered a proximate threat to lungfish populations.

A previous study of mtDNA variation revealed little population genetic structure among populations from British Columbia and Washington State. Here, we used samples from that study, more recent samples from 2 of the same localities, and 2 additional samples, including 1 from Japan, to investigate spatial and temporal genetic variation at 52 mapped, coding, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assayed by high-resolution melting (HRM). Little variation was detected among North American populations, which, as a group, are distinct, perhaps adaptively so, from oysters in Hiroshima, Japan. However, significant excesses of heterozygotes with respect to random mating expectations and of pairwise linkage disequilibria revealed that North American populations are not in Hardy-Weinberg (random mating) equilibrium. Moreover, genetic changes over 10 to 21 yr in 2 localities are substantial, despite high gene flow, and are as large as spatial variance per generation. These results caution against basing connectivity or seascape genetic analyses on snapshots of spatial population structure in high gene-flow species. Because migration and selection are ruled out as causes of temporal genetic change, random genetic drift is the most parsimonious explanation. This implies effective population sizes (Ne) of hundreds to a few thousands, orders of magnitude smaller than the natural abundance (N) of this oyster.

We examined two European species with extensive genomic resources and existing data: the wild boar (Sus scrofa) and the wolf (Canis lupus). Populations of both species declined during the twentieth century, followed by a strong recovery. Moreover, Carpathian Mountain wolves are genetically divergent from Northern European lowland wolves, and their evolutionary history is incompletely understood. We analysed genetic variation from skins of 14 European and Near Eastern wild boars (1903-1948) and 18 Carpathian and Northern wolves (1938-1998). Samples were genotyped in duplicates with standard Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays (wild boar 60 K and wolves 170 K), and we retained SNPs with a genotyping rate of > 90%. We obtained a final set of 1595 SNPs for six wild boars (genotyping rate 0.99) and 1806 SNPs for 18 wolves (genotyping rate 0.96). We merged the best performing duplicate with modern data and calculated polymorphism (P), observed (H-O) and expected (H-E) heterozygosity per population.

We examined two European species with extensive genomic resources and existing data: the wild boar (Sus scrofa) and the wolf (Canis lupus). Populations of both species declined during the twentieth century, followed by a strong recovery. Moreover, Carpathian Mountain wolves are genetically divergent from Northern European lowland wolves, and their evolutionary history is incompletely understood. We analysed genetic variation from skins of 14 European and Near Eastern wild boars (1903-1948) and 18 Carpathian and Northern wolves (1938-1998). Samples were genotyped in duplicates with standard Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays (wild boar 60 K and wolves 170 K), and we retained SNPs with a genotyping rate of > 90%. We obtained a final set of 1595 SNPs for six wild boars (genotyping rate 0.99) and 1806 SNPs for 18 wolves (genotyping rate 0.96). We merged the best performing duplicate with modern data and calculated polymorphism (P), observed (H-O) and expected (H-E) heterozygosity per population.

3661,,Genetic variability in the European bison (Bison bonasus) population from Bialowieza forest over 50 years,"Tokarska, M; Kawalko, A; Wojcik, JM; Pertoldi, C","The aim of this study was to assess potential post-bottleneck temporal genetic differentiation following the reintroduction of the species into the Bialowieza Forest. Variability of 12 polymorphic microsatellite markers was analysed for 178 individuals born between 1955 and 2005, divided by birth year into five temporal groups. Low overall allelic richness (AR) per locus (AR = 2.0) and a low overall expected heterozygosity (H-E = 0.28) were observed. The overall F-IS was not significantly different from zero. The mean F-IS values were, however, significantly different from zero for individuals born between 1955 and 1965 (F-IS = 0.19). A Bayesian computation was used to estimate effective population size (N-e) for each temporal group. We observed relatively small values of N-e ranging from 7.9 to 28.4. The low N-e values confirm that, despite a rapid growth of the bison population following the founder event, N-e increased only slowly.

6652,,High and dry: intermittent watersheds provide a test case for genetic response of desert fishes to climate change,"Turner, TF; Osborne, MJ; McPhee, MV; Kruse, CG","In desert streams, fishes and other organisms that depend on surface water are predicted to inhabit smaller and more isolated wetted reaches, while the frequency and severity of disturbance is expected to increase under most climate change models. Together, these factors should reduce population genetic diversity and persistence probabilities. In this study, our goal was to understand genetic responses of stream fish populations to disturbance in an intermittent stream network. This network is occupied by Rio Grande sucker (Pantosteus plebeius) that is native to highland desert streams in North America. Sample localities in upland perennial reaches were connected by moderate to high levels of gene flow even when separated by up to a 30-km intermittent reach. However, drier and lower-elevation reaches were significant barriers to gene flow. Effects of genetic drift (lower allelic diversity and higher levels of inbreeding) were more pronounced in the watershed with fewest wetted reaches. Temporal analysis of genetic diversity indicated that streams with several spatially distinct wetted reaches were more genetically resistant to wildfire-induced demographic bottlenecks than a stream with only one wetted reach. Maintenance of multiple wetted reaches within streams and facilitated gene flow among watersheds could slow losses of genetic diversity in upland desert stream fishes, and will be important strategies for conserving stream biodiversity in the face of habitat fragmentation and disturbance related to climate change.",turnert@unm.edu,2015,10.1007/s10592-014-0666-0,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,KC,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,,freshwater,Actinopterygii,USA,"Seco,Palomas,Upper Palomas,Animas,Upper Animas","2012.01.01,2003.01.01","50.34.25.15.32,21.21.20.20.16",2,2003.01.01,2012.01.01,1095,pre-designed,"anthorpogenic, natural",climate_change,natural_disaster,env_variation,acute,microsat,fin,ethanol,Phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,,"gene diversity,allelic richness,Fis,Ho,Fst,F-statistics,STRUCTURE,Ne","FSTAT,GENEPOP,ARLEQUIN,AMOVA,STRUCTURE,NeEstimator",,9,,,medium,streams with multiple refugia maintained more diversity post-wildfire than those without refugia,,

2700,,Temporal shifts in the saltmarsh-Nelson's sparrow hybrid zone revealed by replicated demographic and genetic surveys,"Walsh, J; Shriver, WG; Correll, MD; Olsen, BJ; Elphick, CS; Hodgman, TP; Rowe, RJ; O'Brien, KM; Kovach, AI","Conservation of threatened or endangered species in a hybrid zone requires a comprehensive understanding of interspecific dynamics over time and space. We evaluated changes in location and composition of a hybrid zone over a 15-year period (with replicated sampling in 1997-2000 and 2011-2013) for saltmarsh (Ammodramus caudacutus) and Nelson's (A. nelsoni) sparrows, two tidal marsh specialists of high conservation priority in the northeastern United States. We combined genetic analyses using microsatellite and mitochondrial markers with species distribution patterns. In both time periods, replicate genetic sampling (n = 85; five sites) and field population surveys (93 sites) were conducted. We compared the distribution of parental species and hybrids and estimates for hybrid zone width and center between the two time periods. An increase in the relative proportion of Nelson's sparrows in sympatric marshes and an approximate doubling of hybrid zone width provides evidence for expansion. Introgression rates increased over time for neutral loci but declined for a mitochondrial gene and two gene-associated loci under the influence of selection, as expected under a speciation model with barriers to gene flow.

We evaluated changes in location and composition of a hybrid zone over a 15-year period (with replicated sampling in 1997-2000 and 2011-2013) for saltmarsh (Ammodramus caudacutus) and Nelson's (A. nelsoni) sparrows, two tidal marsh specialists of high conservation priority in the northeastern United States. We combined genetic analyses using microsatellite and mitochondrial markers with species distribution patterns. In both time periods, replicate genetic sampling (n = 85; five sites) and field population surveys (93 sites) were conducted. We compared the distribution of parental species and hybrids and estimates for hybrid zone width and center between the two time periods. An increase in the relative proportion of Nelson's sparrows in sympatric marshes and an approximate doubling of hybrid zone width provides evidence for expansion. Introgression rates increased over time for neutral loci but declined for a mitochondrial gene and two gene-associated loci under the influence of selection, as expected under a speciation model with barriers to gene flow.

To understand the effects of inbreeding during early life history stages, we estimated the effects of individual-level heterozygosity on hatching success and first year survival in a Swedish population of sand lizards (Lacerta agilis) over a period of almost a decade, using over 4000 eggs, 400 clutches, and over 3000 juveniles. Heterozygosity had a positive effect on hatching success, in standardized laboratory conditions, but no effect on first year survival. Also, both of these measures of viability varied across the years of the study, demonstrating the importance of temporal heterogeneity in pre and post-hatching conditions. Finally, we identified both paternal and maternal identity effects on hatching success. Thus, we show that selection on heterozygosity was not consistent across developmental life stages, emphasizing the need of considering a number of ontogenic stages, as well as potential parental and environmental effects, when studying the effects of heterozygosity on viability in natural populations.",badreddine.bererhi@bioenv.gu.se,2019,10.1007/s10592-019-01180-6,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,KC,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc reared in captivity -- non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,

By 1992 L. kasmira had spread across the entire archipelago, including locations 2000 km from the release site. Genetic surveys of the source populations reveal diagnostic differences in the mtDNA control region (d = 3.8%; phi(ST) = 0.734, P < 0.001) and significant allele frequency differences at nuclear DNA loci (F-ST = 0.49; P < 0.001). These findings, which indicate that source populations have been isolated for approximately half a million years, set the stage for a survey of the Hawaiian Archipelago (N = 385) to determine the success of these introductions in terms of genetic diversity and breeding behaviour. Both Marquesas and Society mtDNA lineages were detected at each survey site across the Hawaiian Archipelago, at about the same proportion or slightly less than the original 3.4:1 introduction ratio. Nuclear allele frequencies and parentage tests demonstrate that the two source populations are freely interbreeding. The introduction of 2431 Marquesan founders produced only a slight reduction in mtDNA diversity (17%), while the 728 Society founders produced a greater reduction in haplotype diversity (41%). We find no evidence of genetic bottlenecks between islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, as expected under a stepping-stone model of colonization, from the initial introduction site. This species rapidly colonized across 2000 km without loss of genetic diversity, illustrating the consequences of introducing highly dispersive marine species.",gaither@hawaii.edu,2010,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04535.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,museum-dna,KJ,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no temporal comparison,,,,,,,,,,

Lake Superior is the coldest and northernmost of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here, we present an extension of a long-term data set that monitors genetic and phenotypic diversity of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Superior. Hypotheses were investigated pertaining to loss of genetic diversity and genetic homogenization among three lake trout ecomorphs in Lake Superior during their recovery several decades after a major fishery collapse in the early 1960s. Comparison of a contemporary (2004-2013) microsatellite DNA data set to a previously published, post-collapse recovery period data set (1995-1999) indicated substantive losses in genetic diversity. Allelic richness decreased by 5.7%, 12.3%, and 6.8% at Isle Royale, Stannard Rock, and Klondike Reef, respectively. A 60.7% reduction in genetic distance among ecomorphs since the 1990s was detected. Comparisons with a third data set of samples collected during the fishery collapse (1959) indicated an overall 18.2% loss in allelic richness at Isle Royale. The amount of introgression among ecomorphs has likely increased over time. Apparent losses in genetic diversity could be a consequence of historical fishery harvests (early 1900s) exacerbated by intensive stocking (1950s-1980s) and invasions of non-native species (1960s-1990s). Overlap in foraging and breeding areas may have contributed to increasing levels of hybridization among ecomorphs. Knowledge of these processes will help to identify impediments and strategies for the maintenance of lake trout biodiversity in northern Great Lakes, and their re-establishment in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

In the present study, we used the mtDNA D-loop sequence to assess the temporal genetic variation in samples from six successive years for the greater long-tailed hamster, Tscherskia triton. Sampling was carried out between 1998 and 2003 in cropland on the North China Plain, China. A total of 108 individuals were analyzed. The temporal samples showed a high level of genetic diversity. Substantial genetic changes in haplotype frequencies over time were detected for the hamster population. Random genetic drift and migration are likely to be the major factors responsible for the observed temporal pattern. The genetic diversity of the hamster population was higher in years with higher population density, and lower in years with lower population density. The result supports our hypothesis that genetic diversity decreases when population density declines in animals whose population oscillates greatly between years. The combined effects of inbreeding and genetic drift caused by reproduction, dispersal and population size might play important roles in the observed changes in genetic structure and diversity between years.",zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,2006,10.1111/j.1749-4877.2006.00035.x,INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KJ,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,China,Raoyang County,"2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01","20,13,17,20,19,19",6,1998.01.01,2003.01.01,70,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,muscle,ethanol,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,,"haplotype diversity,haplotype number,pi,Fst,Tajima's D,Fu's F,Nef,migration rate","AMOVA,MLNE",,1,,,medium,diversity fluctuated over years corresponding with density (high with high density),,

Historically, more than 50% of the leopard's global range occurred in continental Africa, yet sampling from this part of the species' distribution is only sparsely represented in prior studies examining patterns of genetic variation at the continental or global level. Broad sampling to determine baseline pat terns of genetic variation throughout the leopard's historical distribution is important, as these measures are currently used by the IUCN to direct conservation priorities and management plans. By including data from 182 historical museum specimens, faecal samples from ongoing field surveys, and published sequences representing sub-Saharan Africa, we identify previously unrecognized genetic diversity in African leopards. Our mtDNA data indicates high levels of divergence among regional populations and strongly differentiated lineages in West Africa on par with recent studies of other large verebrates. We provide a reference benchmark of genetic diversity in African leopards against which future monitoring can be compared.

Although ancient DNA approaches have become widely used to monitor the genetic variability of species through time, few studies have been conducted to identify the potential cryptic loss of genetic and species diversity within Pacific seabird species. Here we used heterochronous sampling of mitochondrial DNA (Cytochrome b) in the genus Pterodroma from Norfolk Island to quantify potential loss of genetic and species diversity. We particularly focused on the providence petrel P. solandri whose main breeding colony (1,000,000 breeding pairs) became extirpated from Norfolk Island following European settlement circa 1800. We sampled subfossil bones consistent with Pterodroma spp. from Norfolk Island, and performed genetic comparisons with other populations of P. solandri and congeneric species. The majority of subfossil Norfolk Island individuals exhibited the most common mitochondrial haplotype from Lord Howe Island P. solandri, suggesting no appreciable loss of genetic variation as a consequence of the Norfolk Island extirpation. Our findings provide an example where a large seabird population was rapidly extirpated by humans without loss of species-level genetic diversity, probably as a consequence of high connectivity with other populations. However, past connectivity was insufficient to prevent the extirpation itself, which has conservation implications for predicting the resilience of threatened seabirds. In contrast, ancient DNA analyses of smaller Pterodroma bones from Norfolk Island indicate the loss of a second species, potentially P. pycrofti, P. brevipes or another closely related, possibly undescribed taxon, from the Tasman Sea.",Anicee.Lombal@utas.edu.au,2020,10.1007/s10531-020-01978-8,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,ancient-dna,KJ,RC,reject,ancient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc ancient dna (~1300-1400s),,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of gene flow within and among sympatric long-eared bat species,"Andriollo, T; Ashrafi, S; Arlettaz, R; Ruedi, M","Species are the basic units for measuring biodiversity and for comprehending biological interactions. Yet, their delineation is often contentious, especially in groups that are both diverse and phenotypically conservative. Three cryptic species of long-eared bats, Plecotus auritus, P. austriacus, and P. macrobullaris, co-occur over extensive areas of Western Europe. The latter is a fairly recent discovery, questioning the overall diversity of the entire Plecotus complex. Yet, high morphological and acoustic similarities compromise the reliable identification of long-eared bats in the field. We postulate that such extensive phenotypic overlap, along with the recurrent observation of morphologically intermediate individuals, may hide rampant interspecific hybridization. Based on a geographic sampling centered on areas of sympatry in the Alps and Corsica, we assessed the level of reproductive isolation of these three Plecotus species with mitochondrial and nuclear markers, looking at both inter- and intraspecific genetic population structuring. No sign of hybridization was detected between these three species that appear well separated biologically. Genetic structuring of populations, however, reflected different species-specific responses to environmental connectivity, that is, to the presence of orographic or sea barriers. While the Alpine range and the Ligurian Sea coincided with sharp genetic discontinuities in P. macrobullaris and P. austriacus, the more ubiquitous P. auritus showed no significant population structuration. There were clear phylogeographic discrepancies between microsatellite and mitochondrial markers at the intraspecific level, however, which challenges the reliance on simple barcoding approaches for the delineation of sound conservation units.",tommy.andriollo@ville-ge.ch,2018,10.1002/ece3.4714,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,ACS,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no temporal comparison,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, appropriate management of such animals is important for maintaining the overall genetic diversity of the species. The mtDNA haplotype unique to the Barbary lion, in combination with the small size of the HVR1 analyzed (c. 130 bp), makes it possible and cost-effective to identify unlabelled Barbary specimens kept in museums and """"generic"""" captive lions that may carry the Barbary line. An initial study of five samples from the lion collection of the King of Morocco, tested using this method, shows that they are not maternally Barbary.",ross.barnett@zoo.ox.ac.uk,2006,10.1007/s10592-005-9062-0,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,AAS,RC,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"does not include same spot over multiple times but same species, RC: reject bc mostly about phylogenetics/species or sub-species identification",,,,,,,,,,

Migratory populations breed in eastern Russia and northeastern China, whereas the resident population inhabits the island of Hokkaido, Japan. Although the population inhabiting Hokkaido had experienced a severe bottleneck by the end of the 19th century, the population size has recovered to about 1500 and continues to increase now thanks to conservation efforts. A previous study reported that no marked genetic differences were seen in the island population, and that the genetic variation of the whole population on Hokkaido was lower than that of the continental population. However, the precise genetic structure of the island population in the past or near present remains unclear. To better understand the spatiotemporal changes in the genetic structure of the island population, we performed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses using stuffed specimens (years 1878-2001) and tissue or blood samples (years 1970-2014). We found three haplotypes in the island population, one of which was a novel mtDNA haplotype in 1997 and 2007 samples. In addition, there was no clear difference in the haplotype frequency through the time span. These results suggest that the low genetic variation of the island population persisted for the last hundred years. It is thus nearly impossible for the island population to recover its genetic variation in isolation.

Population genetic comparisons across time periods can help elucidate temporal changes in populations and the processes responsible for the changes. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are wide-ranging carnivores and are currently increasing in abundance across an expanding range. Bobcat populations in New England have fluctuated in the past century in response to changes in their prey base, harvest pressure, and landscape development. We genotyped contemporary (2010-2017) and historic (1952-1964) bobcats from New England and Quebec, Canada at a suite of microsatellite loci and tested for differences in diversity, effective population size, and gene flow. Over 20 generations separated the sampling periods, and the intervening years were marked by drastic changes in land use and species management regimes. We found a general decrease in genetic diversity and differing population genetic structure through time. Effective population size decreased at the end of the historic period, coincident with a spike in harvest, but rebounded to greater numbers in the contemporary period.

Nevertheless, some locally endemic taxa, such as the Galapagos Rail Laterallus spilonota, remain poorly characterized. Owing to its elusive behavior, cryptic plumage, and restricted distribution, the Galapagos Rail is one of the least studied endemic vertebrates of the Galapagos Islands. To date, there is no genetic data for this species, leaving its origins, relationships to other taxa, and levels of genetic diversity uncharacterized. This lack of information is critical given the adverse fate of island rail species around the world in the recent past. Here, we examine the genetics of Galapagos Rails using a combination of mitogenome de novo assembly with multilocus nuclear and mitochondrial sequencing from both modern and historical samples. We show that the Galapagos Rail is part of the """"American black rail clade"""", sister to the Black Rail L. jamaicensis, with a colonization of Galapagos dated to 1.2 million years ago. A separate analysis of one nuclear and two mitochondrial markers in the larger population samples demonstrates a shallow population structure across the islands, possibly due to elevated island connectivity. Additionally, birds from the island Pinta possessed the lowest levels of genetic diversity, possibly reflecting past population bottlenecks associated with overgrazing of their habitat by invasive goats. The modern and historical data presented here highlight the low genetic diversity in this endemic rail species and provide useful information to guide conservation efforts.",jachaves@sfsu.edu; pedrojosemt@hotmail.com; depinoemiliano@gmail.com; sebas_saeu@hotmail.com; brilthormaia@gmail.com; beichman@uw.edu; martin@stervander.com,2020,10.3390/d12110425,DIVERSITY-BASEL,ancient-dna,ACS,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RC: reject, while there are historical samples there is no direct temporal comparison",,,,,,,,,,

It is possible that the evolutionary processes during the post-colonization period may increase the genetic diversity and gene flow among invasive populations over time, facilitating their long-term success. Therefore, genetic diversity and population structure would be expected to show greater temporal variation for successful introduced populations than for native populations. We studied the population genetics of the walnut husk fly, Rhagoletis completa, which was introduced into California from the Midwestern US in the early 1900s. We used microsatellites and allozymes to genotype current and historic fly populations, providing a rare perspective on temporal variability in population genetic parameters. We found that introduced populations showed greater temporal fluctuations in allele frequencies than native populations. Some introduced populations also showed an increase in genetic diversity over time, indicating multiple introductions had occurred. Population genetic structure decreased in both native and introduced populations over time.

Biotas in freshwater wetlands and floodplains, such as those in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB)-one of Australia's most impacted ecosystems, are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic fragmentation. Here we present a comprehensive multilocus assessment of genetic variation in the threatened southern pygmy perch Nannoperca australis (578 individuals; 45 localities; microsatellite, allozyme and mitochondrial DNA datasets), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. We assess patterns of spatial structure and genetic diversity in populations spanning the highly fragmented MDB and test whether recent anthropogenic modification has disrupted range-wide connectivity. We detected strong and hierarchical population structure, very low genetic diversity and lack of contemporary gene flow across the MDB. In contrast, the apparent absence of pronounced or long-term phylogeographic structure suggests that observed population divergences generally do not reflect deeply historic natural fragmentation. Coalescent-based analyses supported this inference, revealing that divergence times between populations from the upper and lower MDB fall into the period of European settlement. It appears that the observed contemporary isolation of populations is partly explained by the severe modification of the MDB post-dating the onset of European settlement. Our integrated approach substantially improves the interpretation of how fragmentation impacts present-day biodiversity. It also provides novel contributions for risk-assessing management actions in the context of captive breeding and translocations of small freshwater fishes, a group of increasing global conservation concern.",Luciano.Beheregaray@flinders.edu.au,2016,10.1007/s10592-016-0868-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,ACS,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RC: reject, while there is resampling there is no direct temporal comparison",,,,,,,,,,

Applying this approach, we examined changes in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (526 base pairs) of the endangered California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus). Results showed >80% reduction in unique haplotypes over the past 2 centuries. We found no spatial sorting of haplotypes in the historical population; the periphery of the range contained haplotypes that were common throughout the historical range. Direct examination of mtDNA from California Condor museum specimens provided a new window into historical population connectivity and genetic diversity showing: (1) a substantial loss of haplotypes, which is consistent with the hypothesis that condors were relatively abundant in the nineteenth century, but declined rapidly as a result of human-caused mortality; and (2) no evidence of historical population segregation, meaning that the available genetic data offer no cause to avoid releasing condors in unoccupied portions of their historical range.",jesse_delia@fws.gov,2016,10.1650/CONDOR-16-35.1,CONDOR,ancient-dna,BR,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Aves,USA,California,"1987.01.01,1904.01.01","12,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,5,3,4,4,3,2,4,3,5,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1",2,1904.01.01,1987.01.01,2555,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,disease,chronic,mtDNA_seq,NA,NA,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,generation time pulled from: https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/birds/California_condor/natural_history.html; multi-generational for contemp only --> offfspring used in place of founders 2X; 1904 is midpoint of all historical samples (1984-1825),"haplotype number,polymorphic sites,pi,haplotype diversity",ARLEQUIN,yes,1,,,strong,large loss of unique haplotypes in contemp population,,

To this end, levels of genetic diversity within the native and invasive range of a species are often compared. Most studies, however, focus solely on contemporary samples, relying heavily on the premise that the historic population structure within the native range has been maintained over time. Here, we assess this assumption by conducting a three-way comparison of the genetic diversity of native (historic and contemporary) and invasive (contemporary) smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) populations. Analyses of a total of 572 M. dolomieu samples, representing the contemporary invasive South African range, contemporary and historical native USA range (dating back to the 1930s when these fish were first introduced into South Africa), revealed that the historical native range had higher genetic diversity levels when compared to both contemporary native and invasive ranges. These results suggest that both contemporary populations experienced a recent genetic bottleneck. Furthermore, the invasive range displayed significant population structure, whereas both historical and contemporary native US populations revealed higher levels of admixture. Comparison of contemporary and historical samples showed both a historic introduction of M. dolomieu and a more recent introduction, thereby demonstrating that undocumented introductions of this species have occurred. Although multiple introductions might have contributed to the high levels of genetic diversity in the invaded range, we discuss alternative factors that may have been responsible for the elevated levels of genetic diversity and highlight the importance of incorporating historic specimens into demographic analyses.",diedericks.genevieve@gmail.com,2018,10.1111/eva.12652,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,historical-dna,EG,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,connectivity,,,freshwater,Actinopterygii,USA,"Oneida River.Hudson River (Saratoga Lake).Susquehanna River (Vestal).Susquehanna River (Oneosta).Susquehanna River (Lolliersville),Niagara River.St Lawrence River.Hudson River,Detroit River,Lake Erie.Potomac River,Auglaize River,Mosquito Creek,Allegheny River.Detroit River,Hudson River (Roundout River),Susquehanna River (Ostelic River).Shenandoah River,Cayuga Lake,Ohio River","2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,1941.01.01,1940.01.01,1938.01.01,1937.01.01,1936.01.01,1935.01.01,1931.01.01,1930.01.01","27.10.14.10.20,49.55.21,7,3.4,5,2,3.18,4,5.4,2,3",2,1935.01.01,2014.01.01,1460,opportunistic,"anthorpogenic, natural",human_exploitation,env_variation,invasive_species,chronic,microsat,muscle,formalin,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,excluding SA sites bc from an introduction (originally reared/stocked in captivity); really just looking at historical vs contemporary locations as whole groups; time points are averages of historical and contemporary groups,"Ho,He,number of alleles,allelic richness, Fst","FSTAT,Arlequin,ANOVA",,8,,,medium,"historical samples highest diversity (also compared to contemp invasive info not provided here), suspect bottleneck due to exploitation, lakes & reservoirs lower div than rivers (where you sample matters!)",,

Samples were characterized from three life history stages. Characterization of wild adults verified previous results that identified considerable diversity and provided baseline data. Samples of larvae from several temporal collections from throughout the spawning season and four geographical areas were characterized for 7 years (1997-2003) to assess the transmission of genetic variation from wild adults to larvae. Several analyses identified significant differences among temporal collections, resulting from sampling errors associated with finite number of females spawning at a given time and place. Comparisons among areas and years failed to identify significant variation, indicating that pooled collections for each year possess the same levels and patterns of genetic variation. Examination of repatriates representing 11 years (1992-2002) also failed to identify significant differences among cohorts; however, some sample sizes were small and the AMOVA may lack sufficient power to detect differences. Contrasts of wild adults, larvae, and repatriates identified statistically significant differences among collections within these three groups; however, levels of variation are small and not biologically meaningful. More importantly, this analysis failed to detect significant differences among adults, larvae, and repatriates indicating that the program has been achieving its goal of transmitting variation from adults through the larvae and into the repatriate population. The reproductive capability of repatriates has not been examined, so it is unknown if the program will maintain genetic variation found in the original adult population. This will be most easily achieved by periodic monitoring of genetic variation in larval samples. If levels of variation become reduced in repatriates, levels and patterns of diversity in larvae are also expected to become reduced, and deviations in estimates of genetic diversity may become larger and more frequent. If this is the case, intervention may be necessary to ensure that certain individuals are not over-represented in the repatriate population.",thomas.dowling@asu.edu,2005,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02408.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,RC,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc reared in captivity -- non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic implications of these declines are unknown. We used historical museum specimens (pre-1960) and contemporary (2001-2005) samples to examine range-wide phylogeographic patterns and investigate potential loss in the species' genetic variation. We obtained sequences (522 bp) of the mitochondrial gene for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) from 268 individuals from across the species' range. Phylogeographic analysis revealed no association with geography or traditional subspecies designations. However, we detected potential reductions in genetic diversity in contemporary samples from California and the Atlantic coast Least Tern from that in historical samples, suggesting that current genetic diversity in Least Tern populations is lower than in their pre-1960 counterparts.

Population declines are often associated with loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious mutations, which can lead to a reduction in fitness and subsequently contribute to extinction. Using temporal approaches can help us understand the effects of population declines on genetic diversity in real time. Sequencing pre-decline as well as post-decline mitogenomes representing all the remaining mitochondrial diversity, we estimated the loss of genetic diversity in the critically endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus). We detected a signal of population expansion coinciding with the end of the Pleistocene last glacial maximum (LGM). Also, we found some evidence for northern and southern lineages, supporting the hypothesis that the species may have been restricted to isolated northern and southern refugia during the LGM. We observed an important loss of neutral genetic diversity associated with European settlement in New Zealand but we could not exclude a population decline associated with Polynesian settlement in New Zealand. However, we did not find evidence for fixation of deleterious mutations. We argue that despite high pre-decline genetic diversity, a rapid and range-wide decline combined with the lek mating system, and life-history traits of kakapo contributed to a rapid loss of genetic diversity following severe population declines.",nicolas.dussex@gmail.com; johanna.vonseth@nrm.se; bruce.robertson@otago.ac.nz; Love.Dalen@nrm.se,2018,10.3390/genes9040220,GENES,historical-dna,RC,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Aves,New Zealand,New Zealand,"1995.01.01,1934.01.01","79,39",2,1934.01.01,1995.01.01,9125,opportunistic,anthropogenic,invasive_species,habitat_loss,human_exploitation,chronic,mtDNA_seq,"blood,skin",dried,"phenol-chloroform,Qiagen",Illumina_HiSeq,PCR,"1995 represents 1985-2005, 1934 represents 1884-1985, skin samples dried but don't know how blood samples were preserved; temporal analysis grouped pre-1900, 1900-1960, and 2001-2005 samples into respective groups","haplotype diversity,pi,Tajima's D, Fu's F,loss of genetic diversity through time,demographic reconstruction,bottleneck models","DnaSP,TempNet,BEAST,ABC (DIYABC)",,1 (mitogenome),,,large,loss of diversity associated with European settlement (here can't preclude New Zealand effect as opposed to Bergener et al. 2016),,

The complex terrain and unique geological history make it a particularly unusual region of the Tibetan Plateau. We carried out a phylogeographical study of two rodent species Neodon irene and Apodemus latronum using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences. High genetic diversities and deep phylogenetic splits were detected in both rodents. Some haplotypes from one sampling region fell into different evolutionary clades, but most haplotypes from the same sampling regions were clustered together with each other. The results of isolation by distance analysis further substantiated that their genetic diversities were structured along geography. Thus, there were high levels of geographical structure for both rodents. Demographic analyses implied a relatively constant population size for all samples of N. irene and A. latronum in history. However, clade B of N. irene and clade 3 of A. latronum experienced population expansions at 105-32 and 156-47 Kya, respectively. Through comparison with previous studies, we suggest the high mitochondrial DNA diversities in them are probably not a species-specific feature, but a common pattern for small mammals in this unique area.

85,,Avian beta-defensin variation in bottlenecked populations: the Seychelles warbler and other congeners,"Gilroy, D; van Oosterhout, C; Komdeur, J; Richardson, DS","beta-defensins are important components of the vertebrate innate immune system responsible for encoding a variety of anti-microbial peptides. Pathogen-mediated selection is thought to act on immune genes and potentially maintain allelic variation in the face of genetic drift. The Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, is an endemic passerine that underwent a recent bottleneck in its last remaining population, resulting in a considerable reduction in genome-wide variation. We genotyped avian beta-defensin (AvBD) genes in contemporary (2000-2008) and museum samples (1876-1940) of the Seychelles warbler to investigate whether immunogenetic variation was lost through this bottleneck, and examined AvBD variation across four other Acrocephalus species with varying demographic histories. No variation was detected at four of the six AvBD loci screened in the post-bottleneck population of Seychelles warbler, but two silent nucleotide polymorphisms were identified at AvBD8 and one potentially functional amino-acid variation was observed at AvBD11. Variation in the Seychelles warbler was significantly lower than in the mainland migratory congeneric species investigated, but it similar to that found in other bottlenecked species. In addition, screening AvBD7 in 15 museum specimens of Seychelles warblers sampled prior to the bottleneck (1877-1905) revealed that this locus possessed two alleles previously, compared to the single allele in the contemporary population. Overall, the results show that little AvBD variation remains in the Seychelles warbler, probably as a result of having low AvBD diversity historically rather than the loss of variation due to drift associated with past demographic history. Given the limited pathogen fauna, this lack of variation at the AvBD loci may currently not pose a problem for this isolate population of Seychelles warblers, but it may be detrimental to the species' long-term survival if new pathogens reach the population in the future.",david.richardson@uea.ac.uk,2016,10.1007/s10592-016-0813-x,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,BR,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Aves,Seychelles,"Cousin Island,Marianne Island","2004.01.01,1908.01.01","20,15",2,1908.01.01,2004.01.01,1460,opportunistic,anthropogenic,invasive_species,habitat_loss,,acute,nuclear_seq,skin,dried,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,"generation time pulled from: Spurgin et al.

438,,Evidence of rapid change in genetic structure and diversity during range expansion in a recovering large terrestrial carnivore,"Hagen, SB; Kopatz, A; Aspi, J; Kojola, I; Eiken, HG","Recovery of natural populations occurs often with simultaneous or subsequent range expansions. According to population genetic theory, genetic structuring emerges at the expansion front together with decreasing genetic diversity, owing to multiple founder events. Thereupon, as the expansion proceeds and connectivity among populations is established, homogenization and a resurgence of genetic diversity are to be expected. Few studies have used a fine temporal scale combined with genetic sampling to track range expansions as they proceed in wild animal populations. As a natural experiment, the historical eradication of large terrestrial carnivores followed by their recovery and recolonization may facilitate empirical tests of these ideas. Here, using brown bear (Ursus arctos) as model species, we tested predictions from genetic theory of range expansion. Individuals from all over Finland were genotyped for every year between 1996 and 2010 using 12 validated autosomal microsatellite markers. A latitudinal shift of about 110 km was observed in the distribution and delineation of genetic clusters during this period. As the range expansion proceeded, we found, as theory predicts, that the degree of genetic structure decreased, and that both genetic variation and admixture increased. The genetic consequences of range expansions may first be detected after multiple generations, but we found major changes in genetic composition after just 1.5 generations, accompanied by population growth and increased migration. These rapid genetic changes suggest an ongoing concerted action of geographical and demographic expansion combined with substantial immigration of bears from Russia during the recovery of brown bears within the large ecosystem of northern Europe.",snorre.hagen@bioforsk.no,2015,10.1098/rspb.2015.0092,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,historical-dna,JW,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,Finland,"Northern Finland,Southern Finland","2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1997.01.01,1996.01.01","56.30,45.24,19.21,29.24,15.23,72.17,39.14,22.16,27.20,28.31,39.16,25.27,32.21,30.21,26.10",3,1998.01.01,2008.01.01,3650,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,,,chronic,STR,NA,ethanol,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,"analyses done on N & S sub-populations, so reporting data that way;assigning as anthropogenic, bc previous human exploitation drove pop size down and seeing effects of that now; temporal analysis grouped into 3 time points: 1996-2000;2000-2005; 2006-2010","STRUCTURE,IBD,Fst,number of alleles,Ho,He,allelic richness,Fis,number of migrants per generation","STRUCTURE,SPAGEDI,Arlequin,GENETIX,GENEPOP",,12,,,large,"rapid change in genetic structure -- range shifted, increase pop growth from south,structuring decreased,variation increased (mostly in south)",,

The dusky gopher frog, Lithobates sevosus, is a critically endangered species found only in coastal Mississippi, with low genetic variability as a consequence of isolation and population size reduction. Conservation management practices have been implemented, but their efficacy has not been addressed. We genotyped individuals collected 1997-2014 to determine temporal trends in population genetic variation, structure, and effective size. Observed and expected heterozygosity and allelic richness revealed temporally stable, but low, levels of genetic variation. Positive levels of inbreeding were found in each year. There was weak genetic structure among years, which can be attributed to increased effects of genetic drift and inbreeding in small populations. L. sevosus exhibited an increase in effective population size, and currently has an estimated effective size of 33.0-58.6 individuals, which is approximately half the census size. This large ratio could possibly be explained by genetic compensation.

In this study, we use whole-genome resequencing to reconstruct a 15x coverage genome based on a historical museum specimen and shed further light on the evolutionary history that preceded the extinction of the Paradise Parrot. By comparing the genetic diversity of this genome with genomes from extant endangered birds, we show that during the species' dramatic decline in the second half of the 19th century, the Paradise Parrot was genetically more diverse than individuals from species that are currently classified as endangered. Furthermore, demographic analyses suggest that the population size of the Paradise Parrot changed with temperature fluctuations during the last glacial cycle.

1635,,Low genetic variation in the heath hen prior to extinction and implications for the conservation of prairie-chicken populations,"Johnson, JA; Dunn, PO","Low genetic variation is often considered to contribute to the extinction of species when they reach small population sizes. In this study we examined the mitochondrial control region from museum specimens of the Heath Hen (Tympanuchus cupido cupido), which went extinct in 1932. Today, the closest living relatives of the Heath Hen, the Greater (T. c. pinnatus), Attwater's (T. c. attwateri) and Lesser (T. pallidicinctus) Prairie-chicken, are declining throughout most of their range in Midwestern North America, and loss of genetic variation is a likely contributor to their decline. Here we show that 30 years prior to their extinction, Heath Hens had low levels of mitochondrial genetic variation when compared with contemporary populations of prairie-chickens. Furthermore, some current populations of Greater Prairie-chickens are isolated and losing genetic variation due to drift. We estimate that these populations will reach the low levels of genetic variation found in Heath Hens within the next 40 years. Genetic variation and fitness can be restored with translocation of individuals from other populations; however, we also show that choosing an appropriate source population for translocation can be difficult without knowledge of historic population bottlenecks and their effect on genetic structure.",jeffai@umich.edu,2006,10.1007/s10592-005-7856-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,JW,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Aves,USA,"Mead,Paul Olson,Buena Vista,Leola","1999.01.01,1953.01.01,1951.01.01","20.20.20.20,18.19,19.17",2,1951.01.01,1999.01.01,730,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,human_exploitation,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,skin,dried,phenol/chloroform,Sanger,PCR,"Only recording Wisconsin pops as these are direct temporal comparison;1951-1954:Mead.Paul Olson,1951:Buena Vista.Leola;generation time pulled from: Bellinger et al.

Excluding Scotland, where the haplotype composition of populations appears to be unchanged, haplotypes found in contemporary and historical marten populations elsewhere differed both temporally and geographically. While these data suggest that the contemporary Irish population is descended from a relict population that passed through an early to mid 1900s bottleneck, the historical and contemporary English and Welsh populations differ in their abundance of specific mtDNA control region haplotypes. These data appear to suggest that particular haplotypes may have been lost from England and Wales at some point in the early to mid 1900s, but further nuclear DNA work is required to determine whether this shift has occurred by rapid genetic drift in the mtDNA control region or whether relict populations have been replaced by pine martens from elsewhere. If the reported shifts in mtDNA haplotypes reflect population extirpation events, historical pine marten populations of England and Wales would appear to have become extinct in the twentieth century (in Wales after 1950 and in England after 1924). Additionally, the recent occurrence of haplotypes originating from continental Europe, and of M. americana, suggest that relict populations of England and Wales have been replaced by, or hybridised with, occasional released, escaped and/or translocated animals.

Samples derived from 27 populations (n = 206) covering the range of three recognized subspecies: L. l. migrans, L. l. ludovicianus, and L. l. excubitorides, and included locales from a putative intergrade zone between two subspecies. For L. l. migrans, samples include both those from extant populations and from museum specimens spanning approximately 130 years. For all samples we obtained 267 base pairs of mitochondrial control region sequence and identified a total of 23 distinct haplotypes. For a subset of samples representing a locale centered on the Canadian portion of an intergrade zone between migrans and excubitorides and locales on alternate sides of the intergrade, we obtained additional sequence for an intron of the nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Analyses of temporal trends in control region diversity of L. l. migrans populations indicate a diminution coincident with the decline in population numbers. Results from an Analysis of Molecular Variance on the control region data showed that a significant amount of total control region spatial variation was apportioned among the three subspecies (24.42%; P < 0.01). Further analyses indicated statistically significant differences between eastern and western populations of L l. migrans. We found no significant differences among considered populations in frequencies of six identified Gpdh alleles, although this result is preliminary because of small sample sizes.

In the absence of validated datasets and despite showing extreme sensitivity to aDNA quality, these methods have been used in many published studies, sometimes with additions of arbitrary filters or modifications, designed to overcome aDNA degradation and contamination problems. The general lack of best practices for aDNA mutation calling may lead to inaccurate results. To address these problems, we present ARIADNA (ARtificial Intelligence for Ancient DNA), a novel approach based on machine learning techniques, using specific aDNA characteristics as features to yield improved mutation calls. In our comparisons of variant callers across several ancient genomes, ARIADNA consistently detected higher-quality genome variants with fast runtimes, while reducing the false positive rate compared with other approaches.",andrey.grigoriev@rutgers.edu,2018,10.1093/dnares/dsy029,DNA RESEARCH,adna,KF,RC,reject,ancient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc ancient dna,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions reflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether new genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the expansion of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe during the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary populations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography and genetic changes associated with the range shift.

10159,,Genetic monitoring to evaluate reintroduction attempts of a highly endangered rodent,"La Haye, MJJ; Reiners, TE; Raedts, R; Verbist, V; Koelewijn, HP","The ultimate strategy to prevent species extinction is captive breeding followed by reintroduction of individuals into the wild. Unfortunately, overall success of reintroductions is poor and in most cases conservation breeding is applied for species where individual numbers, population numbers and genetic diversity is strongly reduced. In addition, reintroductions inevitably result in small populations with poor genetic status. Systematic demographic and genetic monitoring is needed to optimize conservation actions. Here we show how genetic monitoring was useful and informative in a reintroduction project for the highly endangered Common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) in the Netherlands and Belgium. Using well defined breeding lines of original relict populations combined with a systematic reintroduction scheme including consecutive supplementations made it possible to infer success of reintroduction, supplementation and following admixture of populations. An initial loss of genetic diversity could be detected in some of the reintroduced populations, but it could be shown that due to following supplementation of populations, genetic diversity and also effective population size in the wild stabilized or even increased. Multivariate (DAPC) and Bayesian inference (STRUCTURE) revealed admixture of supplemented individuals with wild-born individuals. Although population size estimates differed strongly between populations, a link between census size, breeding lines, effective population size and genetic diversity could not be proven. This study highlights that genetic monitoring is not only descriptive but also reveals detailed information on reintroduction success, admixture and population development. We recommend that genetic monitoring should be a basic element of reintroductions and should be used to optimize reintroduction attempts.",maurice.lahaye@wur.nl,2017,10.1007/s10592-017-0940-z,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,AAS,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc captive breeding program -- non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive fur seal harvesting during the nineteenth century on Macquarie Island (subantarctic) resulted in extinction of the original population. Recolonization by three species has been slow and complex, characterized by the establishment of breeding groups of Antarctic and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and Arctocephalus tropicalis) and presumed nonbreeding (itinerant) male New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri). One thousand and seven pups from eight annual cohorts (1992-2003) were analysed using mitochondrial control region data (RFLP) and 10 microsatellite loci to estimate species composition and hybridization. Antarctic fur seals predominated, but hybridization occurred between all three species (17-30% of all pups). Involvement of New Zealand fur seals was unexpected as females are absent and males are not observed to hold territories during the breeding season. The proportion of hybrids in the population has fallen over time, apparently owing to substantial influxes of pure Antarctic and subantarctic individuals and non-random mating. Over 50% of New Zealand hybrids and 43% of Antarctic-subantarctic hybrids were not F-1, which indicates some degree of hybrid reproductive success, and this may be underestimated: simulations showed that hybrids become virtually undetectable by the third generation of backcrossing. While human impacts seem to have driven novel hybridization in this population, the present 'time slices' analysis suggests some biological resistance to complete homogenization.",melanie.lancaster@sci.monash.edu.au,2006,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03041.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,AAS,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,yes,other,Mammalia,Australia (Tasmania),Macquarie Island,"2003.01.01,2001.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1996.01.01,1995.01.01,1994.01.01,1992.01.01","162,149,141,135,125,117,104,74",9,1992.01.01,2003.01.01,3650,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,,,chronic,microsat,skin,"DMSO,ethanol",CTAB protocol (Murray & Thompson 1980),LI-COR IR2 two-dye,PCR,"bc hybridization study, not splitting into multiple rows for each species (really all species are being analyzed ""together"");generation time estimated from: Paijmans et al.

By accessing genetic datasets through museum sampling, we are able to put current levels of genetic diversity and hybridization with congenerics into a historical context for enhanced conservation. In this study, we compared neutral genetic diversity of the now extinct Fernandina population to historical and current diversity of the Isabela population using 14 microsatellite markers. We found that current genetic diversity of the last remnant population (similar to 80-100 individuals) is far below levels 100 years ago, with only about half of the allelic diversity retained. Current genetic diversity is close to levels in the Fernandina population that went extinct by the 1970s. Bottleneck analysis did not show a strong signature of recent decline, and instead implies that this species may have consistently had low population sizes with wide fluctuations. Hybridization with congeneric woodpecker finches was found in the modern Isabela population, implying that some individuals within the few remaining breeding pairs are finding mates with woodpecker finches. Within the context of historical low population sizes and wide fluctuations, current conservation efforts may help the mangrove finch face current extinction threats and avoid the fate of the Fernandina population.

However, because wolves disperse over long distances, extant populations in Canada and Alaska might have retained a substantial proportion of the genetic diversity once found in the cUS. We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequences of 34 pre-extermination wolves and found that they had more than twice the diversity of their modern conspecifics, implying a historic population size of several hundred thousand wolves in the western cUS and Mexico.

Modern and historic processes that limit population size can contribute to a loss of genetic variation that can reduce future adaptability of a species. Buff-breasted Sandpipers (Calidris subruficollis) are a Neotropical migratory shorebird that experienced rapid, large-scale declines in population numbers (population bottleneck) due to intensive market hunting at the turn of the 20th century. Market hunting ended shortly after the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918, but subsequent population losses have occurred due to continued anthropogenic disturbances throughout the species' migratory range. To assess the impact of population declines on the genetic variation of Buff-breasted Sandpipers, we surveyed two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, the control region and cytochrome b, from 209 museum specimens collected between 1874 and 1983 and 460 modern samples collected between 1993 and 2009. Measures of mtDNA variation did not change significantly among individuals sampled before and after the ban on market hunting, nor among four temporal groups (Pre-Act, Early Post-Act, Late Post-Act, and Modern; trend analysis: chi (2) = 0.171, P = 0.679). Similarly, we did not observe loss of common haplotypes, implying that there was no substantial reduction in unique matrilineal units during our 135-year study period. Using Bayesian Skyline reconstruction of temporal changes in effective population size of females (N (ef)), we concluded that N (ef) has been stable for the past century. Results of resampling suggest that diversity estimators can be imprecise and we emphasize the importance of a well-rounded analytical approach to addressing conservation genetic hypotheses. Considering all of the evidence it appears that genetic variation and N (ef) were stable despite the pressures of market hunting early in the 20th century and habitat loss and degradation in the latter half of the 20th century. Conservation efforts should continue to focus on maintaining the population size of Buff-breasted Sandpipers to avoid reaching a threshold where genetic variability is lost.",wisely@ufl.edu,2014,10.1007/s10592-014-0611-2,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,ACS,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,,other,Aves,"Canada,USA,Costa Rica,Ecuador,Paraguay,Uraguay,Brazil,Argentina",Americas,"2001.01.01,1971.01.01,1939.01.01,1896.01.01","51,55,51,46",4,1896.01.01,2001.01.01,1642,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,climate_change,chronic,mtDNA_seq,"feather,skin",dried,phenol-chloroform,Cycle,PCR,"bc migrating species, just pooled all samples from all countries together; 1896 represents 1874-1919, 1939 represents 1920-1959, 1971 represents 1960-1983, 2001 represents 1993-2009; 2001 ""modern"" samples were actually 460 individuals, but bootstrapped down to 51 to get similar sample size as historical ones; generation time pulled from: https://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/cosewic/sr_becasseau_roussatre_buffbreasted_sandpiper_1012_e.pdf","loss of matrilines,change in haplotype distribution,number of haplotypes,haplotype diversity,pi,unique haplotypes/individuals,Watterson's theta","Tempnet R package,DnaSP,AMOVA,Arlequin",,2,,,large,"no real change in diversity OR Ne among any of the temporal periods -- pooled samples based on major human actions that could have impacted them (before v. after Migratory Bird Act, etc.); resampling effects suggest that diversity estimators can be imprecise so make sure analytics are well-thought-out (esp if large discrepancies in sample sizes)",,

Once widespread across Southeast Asia, it is now on the verge of extinction, with only one wild population remaining (estimated at similar to 60 individuals) on the island of Java, Indonesia. To assess the past genetic diversity of the female lineage of R. sondaicus, we generated mitochondrial genome data from eight museum specimens dating back to the 19th century, before the range of the Javan rhinoceros was dramatically reduced, for comparison against mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of current R. sondaicus and other rhinoceros species. We succeeded in reconstructing five full and three partial ancient mitogenomes from the eight samples. We used BEAST to assess the phylogenetic relationship of the five extant rhinoceros species and the historical samples. The results show that the oldest and most diverse mtDNA lineages of R. sondaicus are found in historical samples, indicating a significant reduction of mtDNA diversity in modern Javan rhinos. We anticipate that the newly sequenced data will represent a useful resource for improving our understanding of evolutionary history of this species, should future studies be able to increase the available dataset.

6721,,Low genetic diversity in an endangered species: recent or historic pattern?,"Matocq, MD; Villablanca, FX","Examining patterns of genetic diversity has become an integral component of many management plans concerning endangered species, yet interpreting the processes underlying such patterns remains challenging. We demonstrate low genetic diversity in a critically endangered small mammal population. A common interpretation of this pattern would be that it is the result of a known, recent decline in this population. We test this interpretation and find it to be incorrect. Instead, by using museum voucher specimens, we show that the pattern of low genetic diversity is historical. This study demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate reference groups by which to interpret modern levels of genetic diversity in endangered species. We conclude that analysis of archival specimens may be essential in cases where genetic diversity is driving conservation management decisions because it may allow us to distinguish the effects of low genetic diversity from the process of losing diversity. We recognize that this approach can be limited due to several sampling issues: archival material may not be available, statistical power needs to be evaluated, sample sizes and sequence lengths may be suboptimal due to intrinsic difficulties associated with amplification of degraded DNA. These issues are discussed and possible solutions identified. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The individual had the sequence identical with that reported for an individual from San'in District of Western Japan, far from the Kiso River, and is thought to have been introduced artificially.

Contractions are often incomplete, leaving small remnant groups in refugia throughout the former range. Little is known about the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes that influence how remnant groups are affected during range expansion. We used data from a spatially explicit, long-term genetic sampling effort of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE), USA, to identify the demographic processes underlying spatial and temporal patterns of genetic diversity. We conducted parentage analysis to evaluate how reproductive success and dispersal contribute to spatio-temporal patterns of genetic diversity in remnant groups of grizzly bears existing in the southwestern (SW), southeastern (SE) and east-central (EC) regions of the NCDE. A few reproductively dominant individuals and local inbreeding caused low genetic diversity in peripheral regions that may have persisted for multiple generations before eroding rapidly (approx. one generation) during population expansion. Our results highlight that individual-level genetic and reproductive dynamics play critical roles during genetic assimilation, and show that spatial patterns of genetic diversity on the leading edge of an expansion may result from historical demographic patterns that are highly ephemeral.",nmikle@usgs.gov,2016,10.1098/rspb.2016.1467,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,historical-dna,KJ,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,USA,"EC_Glacier NP, SE_Glacier NP, SW_Glacier NP","2012.01.01,2010.01.01,2004.01.01","120.72.32,104.64.32,98.45.28",3,2004.01.01,2012.01.01,3650,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,,chronic,microsat,hair,dried,NA,NA,NA,2012 represents 2011-2012 & 2010 represents 2009-2010; library prep/sequencing method not described either in original paper or in cited paper so leaving blank,"allelic richness,Ho,He,Fis","bootstrapped changes through time (between time periods) of genetic metrics,parentage analysis",yes,7,,,large,parentage analysis to evaluate how reproductive success and dispersal contribute to genetic diversity -- few reproductively dominant individuals and inbreeding caused low diversity that may have persisted for a while before disappearing during expansion -- ties historical demographic patterns to current spatial dynamics,,

Biological invasions have caused dramatic changes in native biodiversity and ecosystem function. Studies of genetic variation and evolutionary changes are useful for understanding population dynamics during biological invasions, and shed light on management, prevention and restoration strategies. Aims. This study aimed to investigate the structure and genetic variability of American mink (Neovison vison) an invasive species in southern South America, introduced for fur farming in the 1930s. Methods. Samples from 153 mink were obtained from 12 locations in southern Chile to sequence the mitochondria) DNA (mtDNA) control region and to genotype 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Key results. The highest mtDNA diversity was detected in Puerto Cisnes, suggesting multiple introductions and/or the most probable area where mink was first introduced. The latter is also supported by microsatellite data, because a high percentage of individuals from different locations were assigned to this location. All other locations showed low or no mtDNA diversity, possibly due to founder effect. The results also indicate marked population structure, with three genetic clusters coincident with the main historical introduction points, with low dispersal among them. Conclusions. The results suggest that control strategies for American mink in southern Chile should be concentrated on these three genetically differentiated management units, and particularly on source populations and locations with low effective population size and restricted connectivity.",jvianna@uc.cl,2018,10.1071/WR18026,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,historical-dna,KC,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no temporal comparisons,,,,,,,,,,

The emergence and spread of DFTD has been linked to low genetic diversity in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We examined MHC diversity in historical and ancient devils to determine whether loss of diversity is recent or predates European settlement in Australia. Our results reveal no additional diversity in historical Tasmanian samples. Mainland devils had common modern variants plus six new variants that are highly similar to existing alleles.

1817,,Temporal variation of genetic composition in Atlantic salmon populations from the Western White Sea Basin: influence of anthropogenic factors?,"Ozerov, MY; Veselov, AE; Lumme, J; Primmer, CR","Background: Studies of the temporal patterns of population genetic structure assist in evaluating the consequences of demographic and environmental changes on population stability and persistence. In this study, we evaluated the level of temporal genetic variation in 16 anadromous and 2 freshwater salmon populations from the Western White Sea Basin (Russia) using samples collected between 1995 and 2008. To assess whether the genetic stability was affected by human activity, we also evaluated the effect of fishing pressure on the temporal genetic variation in this region. Results: We found that the genetic structure of salmon populations in this region was relatively stable over a period of 1.5 to 2.5 generations. However, the level of temporal variation varied among geographical regions: anadromous salmon of the Kola Peninsula exhibited a higher stability compared to that of the anadromous and freshwater salmon from the Karelian White Sea coast. This discrepancy was most likely attributed to the higher census, and therefore effective, population sizes of the populations inhabiting the rivers of the Kola Peninsula compared to salmon of the Karelian White Sea coast. Importantly, changes in the genetic diversity observed in a few anadromous populations were best explained by the increased level of fishing pressure in these populations rather than environmental variation or the negative effects of hatchery escapees. The observed population genetic patterns of isolation by distance remained consistent among earlier and more recent samples, which support the stability of the genetic structure over the period studied. Conclusions: Given the increasing level of fishing pressure in the Western White Sea Basin and the higher level of temporal variation in populations exhibiting small census and effective population sizes, further genetic monitoring in this region is recommended, particularly on populations from the Karelian rivers.",mikhail.ozerov@utu.fi,2013,10.1186/1471-2156-14-88,BMC GENETICS,temporal-genetics,KJ,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,adaptation,,,other,Actinopterygii,Russia,"Kachkovka,Ponoi,Danilovka,Sosnovka,Babya,Likhodeevka,Pulonga (Kola), Pyalitsa,Chaporna,Strelna,Chavanga,Indera,Varzuga,Nilma,Pulonga (Karelia),Pongoma,Pisto,Kamennaya","2008.01.01,2005.01.01,2001.01.01,1999.01.01,1995.01.01","66.93.43.46.41.46.76.26.49.63.41.60.51,32.56.41.39.29,41.44,37.42.43.50.55.57,38",2,1995.01.01,2008.01.01,1752,opportunistic,"anthorpogenic, natural",human_exploitation,env_variation,,chronic,microsat,fin,ethanol,salt (Aljanabi & Martinez 1999); silica-based (Elphinstone et al. 2003),Sanger,PCR,"some pops considered freshwater (Pisto & Kamennaya); some data taken from Tonteri et al.

While genetic techniques are commonly applied in extant populations to assess temporal and spatial demographic changes, it is no substitute for directly measuring past diversity using ancient DNA (aDNA). We analysed both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear microsatellite loci from 64 historical fossil and skin samples of the critically endangered Western Australian woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi), and compared them with 231 (n=152 for mtDNA) modern samples. In modern woylie populations 15 mitochondrial control region (CR) haplotypes were identified. Interestingly, mtDNA CR data from only 29 historical samples demonstrated 15 previously unknown haplotypes and detected an extinct divergent clade. Through modelling, we estimated the loss of CR mtDNA diversity to be between 46% and 91% and estimated this to have occurred in the past 2000-4000years in association with a dramatic population decline. In addition, we obtained near-complete 11-loci microsatellite profiles from 21 historical samples. In agreement with the mtDNA data, a number of new' microsatellite alleles was only detected in the historical populations despite extensive modern sampling, indicating a nuclear genetic diversity loss >20%. Calculations of genetic diversity (heterozygosity and allelic rarefaction) showed that these were significantly higher in the past and that there was a high degree of gene flow across the woylie's historical range. These findings have an immediate impact on how the extant populations are managed and we recommend the implementation of an assisted migration programme to prevent further loss of genetic diversity.

For the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera L., this is particularly important because its populations are currently under threat worldwide and have experienced many changes in management and environment over the last century. Using Swiss Apis mellifera mellifera as a case study, our research provides important insights into the genetic diversity of native honey bees prior to the industrial-scale introductions and trade of non-native stocks during the 20th century-the onset of intensive commercial breeding and the decline of wild honey bees following the arrival of Varroa destructor. We sequenced whole-genomes of 22 honey bees from the Natural History Museum in Bern collected in Switzerland, including the oldest A. mellifera sample ever sequenced. We identify both, a historic and a recent migrant, natural or human-mediated, which corroborates with the population history of honey bees in Switzerland. Contrary to what we expected, we find no evidence for a significant genetic bottleneck in Swiss honey bees, and find that genetic diversity is not only maintained, but even slightly increased, most probably due to modern apicultural practices. Finally, we identify signals of selection between historic and modern honey bee populations associated with genes enriched in functions linked to xenobiotics, suggesting a possible selective pressure from the increasing use and diversity of chemicals used in agriculture and apiculture over the last century.",melanie.parejo@ehu.eus,2020,10.1093/gbe/evaa188,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,KC,RC,reject,non-wildlife,empirical,diversity,adaptation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rejecting bc modern samples from apiaries (non-wildlife) & that has direct implications for results -- think diversity increased bc of monitored breeding efforts,,,,,,,,,,

Zoological Studies 50(2): 220-229. In this study we assessed levels of genetic divergence and variability in 208 individuals of the supralittoral sandhopper Macarorchestia remyi, a species strictly associated with rotted wood stranded on sand beaches, by analyzing sequence polymorphisms in a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene coding cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI). The geographical distribution and ecology of the species are poorly known. The study includes 1 Tyrrhenian and 2 Adriatic populations sampled along the Italian peninsula plus a single individual found on Corfu Is. (Greece). The Tyrrhenian population was sampled monthly for 1 yr. Genetic data revealed a deep phylogeographic break between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic populations with no shared haplotypes. The single individual collected on Corfu Is. carried the most common haplotype found in the Tyrrhenian population. A mismatch analysis could not reject the hypothesis of a sudden demographic expansion in almost all but 2 monthly samples. When compared to previous genetic data centered on a variety of Mediterranean talitrids, our results place M. remyi among those species with profound intraspecific divergence (sandhoppers) and dissimilar from beachfleas, which generally display little population genetic structuring. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/50.2/220.pdf",laura.pavesi@uniroma1.it,2011,,ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES,temporal-genetics,BR,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,connectivity,,,other,Malacostraca,Italy,Principina a Mare,"2007.04.01,2007.03.01,2007.02.01,2007.01.01,2006.12.01,2006.11.01,2006.10.01,2006.09.01,2006.08.01,2006.07.01,2006.06.01,2006.05.01","15,15,15,15,15,15,15,14,15,15,15,14",12,2006.05.01,2007.04.01,180,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,NA,ethanol,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,sandhopper (lives on beaches and semi-terrestrial?); generation time pulled from: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-009-9909-3,"haplotype number,polymorphic sites,pi,haplotype diversity,Fst","ARLEQUIN,AMOVA",,1,,,medium,"some yearly cycling of genetic diversity levels, tied to breeding peaks",,

Samples (n = 702) genotyped were divided into 16 putative populations based on collection time and site. Fixation indices (F-statistics), analysis of molecular variance, and discriminant analysis of principal components were used to examine within and among population genetic variation.

Broad range ofF(ST)(0.0-0.2742) andF(IS)(0.0-0.2330) values indicated different genotype frequencies between and within the populations, respectively. High genetic diversity within and low genetic differentiation between populations was found in 2002 and 2005. Interestingly, high genetic differentiation between populations from two collection sites observed in 2018 populations was not evident in within-site comparisons of putative populations collected on different dates during the season.

We used phylogeography, population genetics and coalescent methods to assess the potential effects of climatic oscillations in the Pleistocene and contemporary oceanographic barriers on the population genetic structure and connectivity of the species. Sequence analyses indicated high genetic diversity and a lack of genetic differentiation throughout the Caribbean and between the two biogeographic provinces. Different lines of evidence depicted demographic expansions of A. saxatilis populations dated to the Pleistocene. The microsatellites exhibited high genetic diversity, and no genetic differentiation was detected within the Caribbean; however, these markers identified a genetic discontinuity between the two western Atlantic biogeographic provinces. Migration estimates revealed gene flow across the Amazon Orinoco Plume, suggesting that genetic divergence may be promoted by differential environmental conditions on either side of the barrier.

Phylogenetic analyses indicated that this genome, which was aligned with a number of historical and extant wolf and dog mitogenomes sampled worldwide, was closely related to an Italian wolf mtDNA genome (the observed proportion of nucleotide sites at which the two sequences are different was p = 0.0012), five to seven times shorter than divergence among Sicilian and any other known wolf mtDNA genomes (p range = 0.0050 - 0.0070). Sicilian and Italian mitogenomes joined a basal clade belonging to the mtDNA haplogroup-2 of ancient western European wolf populations (Pilot et al., 2010). Bayesian calibration of divergence times indicated that this clade coalesced at MRCA = 13.400 years (with 95% HPD = 4000 - 21.230 years).

We used microsatellite and mtDNA control-region haplotype data to examine the relatedness of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) offspring in multiply parasitized nests sampled from a heavily parasitized host community in northeastern Kansas. We also examined how host nest availability influenced the degree of multiple parasitism, and used community-wide parasitism data to explore whether female cowbirds were constrained in their laying decisions. Relatedness estimates for all suitable pairwise comparisons (n = 94 from 41 multiply parasitized nests) found that the mean likelihood than an individual cowbird in a multiply parasitized nest shared its nest with a full sibling was 40.4% (95% confidence interval: 28.4-52.4%), indicating that many cowbird offspring were reared with full siblings. Extensive community-wide parasitism data revealed that most cowbird offspring shared the nest with >= 1 other conspecific. Additionally, we found that the proportion of available host nests increased steeply at the start of the breeding season and remained high for most of the breeding season, but that the degree of multiple parasitism was unrelated to the number of new nests. We found evidence that laying decisions of female cowbirds were constrained, which suggests that heavy parasitism levels were due to a high degree of competition for host nests. This intense competition for host nests, in turn, results in cowbird offspring often competing with conspecifics in our population, including full siblings, for host parental care.

267,,Molecular phylogenetics of the spider family Micropholcommatidae (Arachnida : Araneae) using nuclear rRNA genes (18S and 28S),"Rix, MG; Harvey, MS; Roberts, JD","The spider family Micropholcommatidae is an enigmatic taxon of uncertain limits and uncertain affinities. Various phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed for the family, but these hypotheses have never been tested with a robust phylogenetic analysis. The existence of similar Australasian and New World taxa, the possibility of morphological convergence associated with extreme 'smallness', and the apparent paucity of synapomorphic morphological characters, have all clouded generic relationships in this group. We used fragments from two nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (18S and 28S) to test the monophyly and phylogenetic position of the Micropholcommatidae. The analyses incorporated 50 ingroup spider species, including 23 micropholcommatid species and representatives from 14 other spider families. Ribosomal RNA secondary structures were inferred for the V3-V5 region of the 18S rRNA gene, and Domain 11 of the 28S rRNA gene of Hickmania troglodytes [Higgins, E.T., Petterd, W.F., 1883. Description of a new cave-inhabiting spider, together with notes on mammalian remains from a recently discovered cave in the Chudleigh district. Pap. Proc. R. Soc. Tasman. 1882, 191-192]. These secondary structures were used to guide multiple sequence alignments, and determine the position and nature of indels in different taxa. Secondary structure information was also incorporated into a structurally partitioned rRNA analysis in MrBayes Version 3.1.2, using a doublet model of nucleotide substitution. This structurally partitioned rRNA analysis provided a less resolved but more conservative and informative estimate of phylogeny than an otherwise identical, unpartitioned rDNA analysis. With the exception of the Chilean species Teutoniella cekalovici [Platnick, N.I., Forster, R.R., 1986. On Teutoniella, an American genus of the spider family Micropholcommatidae (Araneae, Palpimanoidea). Am. Mus.

Teutoniella cekalovici never grouped with the other micropholcommatid taxa, and could not be assigned to any family group with confidence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1630,,A portrait of a sucker using landscape genetics: how colonization and life history undermine the idealized dendritic metapopulation,"Salisbury, SJ; Mccracken, GR; Keefe, D; Perry, R; Ruzzante, DE","Dendritic metapopulations have been attributed unique properties by in silico studies, including an elevated genetic diversity relative to a panmictic population of equal total size. These predictions have not been rigorously tested in nature, nor has there been full consideration of the interacting effects among contemporary landscape features, colonization history and life history traits of the target species. We tested for the effects of dendritic structure as well as the relative importance of life history, environmental barriers and historical colonization on the neutral genetic structure of a longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus) metapopulation in the Kogaluk watershed of northern Labrador, Canada. Samples were collected from eight lakes, genotyped with 17 microsatellites, and aged using opercula. Lakes varied in differentiation, historical and contemporary connectivity, and life history traits. Isolation by distance was detected only by removing two highly genetically differentiated lakes, suggesting a lack of migration-drift equilibrium and the lingering influence of historical factors on genetic structure. Bayesian analyses supported colonization via the Kogaluk's headwaters. The historical concentration of genetic diversity in headwaters inferred by this result was supported by high historical and contemporary effective sizes of the headwater lake, T-Bone. Alternatively, reduced allelic richness in headwaters confirmed the dendritic structure's influence on gene flow, but this did not translate to an elevated metapopulation effective size. A lack of equilibrium and upstream migration may have dampened the effects of dendritic structure. We suggest that interacting historical and contemporary factors prevent the achievement of the idealized traits of a dendritic metapopulation in nature.",Sarah.Salisbury@Dal.ca,2016,10.1111/mec.13757,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,KC,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc no temporal comparisons,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report on artifact base changes in mitochondrial DNA sequences amplified from relatively recent (<= 35 years) museum specimens of indigobirds (Vidua spp.). Single base errors were confirmed by replicate sequencing and included both double peaks and artifact substitutions at rates of similar to 3 x 10(-4) and similar to 1 x 10(-4) per base- pair, respectively, resulting in one or more errors or ambiguities in an 1100 base pair sequence in 21% of 219 samples. Most errors involved C -> T changes on the L-strand, presumably due to deamination of cytosine in the template. The error rates encountered here bias comparisons of haplotype number between historical and extant populations, such that the `loss' of artifact haplotypes present in a historical sample could be incorrectly attributed to a population decline or bottleneck. Sequencing errors due to miscoding lesions in template DNA have so far been reported only from ancient and formalin-fixed tissue, but they may also affect relatively recent museum samples, as shown here, and perhaps also non-invasive samples that typically yield low-quality DNA.",kristina.sefc@uni-graz.at,2007,10.1007/s10592-006-9240-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,KC,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,,terrestrial,Aves,"South Africa,Zimbabwe,Zambia,Malawi,Botswana",Africa,"1996.01.01,1969.01.01","103,129",2,1969.01.01,1996.01.01,748,opportunistic,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,feather,dried,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,"modern samples from other study (Sorenson et al.

5966,,Complete loss of MHC genetic diversity in the Common Hamster (Cricetus cricetus) population in The Netherlands. Consequences for conservation strategies,"Smulders, MJM; Snoek, LB; Booy, G; Vosman, B","The Common Hamster (Cricetus cricetus L.) has suffered from changes in agricultural practices. In some Western European countries the populations have become so small and scattered that they are threatened with extinction. We studied the genetic diversity of mitochondrial and major histoincompatibility complex (MHC) loci in the few animals left in the South of the Netherlands and in three animals from the Alsace region in France, and compared it to the diversity in Dutch animals in the past (samples taken from stuffed animals in museum collections dating back to the period 1924-1956) and in a large present-day population from Czech Republic. For the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, SNP mapping demonstrated a total of nine alleles among 14 Czech samples, of which one (possibly two) was present in the Dutch museum samples, and only one in the current Dutch animals. For the MHC genes, DQA exon 2 and 3 showed no variation, while 14 different alleles were found at DRB exon 2. The Czech population contained 13 different alleles in 15 animals sampled, and most animals were heterozygous (H-o = 0.80, H-e = 0.91). Therefore, the solitary living Hamster maintains, in nature, a large diversity at this MHC locus. The Dutch museum samples contained eight different alleles in 20 samples, and they were slightly less heterozygous (H-o = 0.60, H-e = 0.75). All but one of these alleles were also found in the Czech samples. In contrast, the present Dutch and French animals (a total of 16 samples) contained only one of these alleles, and all animals were genetically identical and homozygous. We conclude that the remaining animals have lost all diversity at this MHC locus. This is probably the result of a severe bottleneck, which may have been quite severe, reducing diversity in many loci. In addition, the remaining Dutch animals are partly derived from one family. These animals are now part of a breeding program. Options for restocking the genetic diversity are discussed.",,2003,10.1023/A:1024767114707,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,KJ,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RC: reject bc non-wildlife (modern Dutch samples from breeding program, all same litter)",,,,,,,,,,

Significant latitudinal clines for the frequencies of A(ST), E-ST, O-ST, and U-ST chromosomal arrangements have been detected in the old and new samples. Standard gene arrangements are frequent in the north and decrease in frequency towards the south. Significant negative regression coefficients between latitude and transformed Frequency have also been observed for the snore frequent nonstandard gene arrangements. The pattern of the clines is practically the same in the old and new collections. Furthermore, the frequencies of acne arrangements of all chromosomes have changed significantly during this period in a systematic way: an increase in the frequency of those arrangements typical of southern latitudes and a decrease for those more common in northern latitudes is observed in all populations. These changes could be due to climatic factors that arc correlated with latitude, making the chromosomal composition of this species more """"southern.""""",lluis@bio.ub.es,2002,,EVOLUTION,temporal-genetics,JW,RC,reject,non-genomic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RC: reject, non-genomic study (looking at karyotypes)",,,,,,,,,,

Concordant with the initial assessment, spectacled eiders were highly structured at mitochondrial (mt) DNA and lacked differentiation at microsatellite loci. The degree and spatial pattern of structure has changed at mtDNA; a 33.0-40.3% reduction in overall F-ST and phi(ST), respectively, and a marked reduction in pairwise F-ST (- 83.1 to - 91.4%) among Alaska sites.

Dependable methods to sequence such specimens are especially critical if the specimens are unique. We attempt to sequence small-bodied (3-6mm) historical specimens (including nomenclatural types) of beetles that have been housed, dried, in museums for 58-159years, and for which few or no suitable replacement specimens exist. To better understand ideal approaches of sample preparation and produce preparation guidelines, we compared different library preparation protocols using low amounts of input DNA (1-10ng). We also explored low-cost optimizations designed to improve library preparation efficiency and sequencing success of historical specimens with minimal DNA, such as enzymatic repair of DNA. We report successful sample preparation and sequencing for all historical specimens despite our low-input DNA approach. We provide a list of guidelines related to DNA repair, bead handling, reducing adapter dimers and library amplification. We present these guidelines to facilitate more economical use of valuable DNA and enable more consistent results in projects that aim to sequence challenging, irreplaceable historical specimens.",johnssproul@gmail.com,2017,10.1111/1755-0998.12660,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,ancient-dna,JW,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RC: good methods paper, but no actual temporal analyses (just about library prep w/a bit of phylogenetics)",,,,,,,,,,
8708,,The origin of recently established red fox populations in the United States: translocations or natural range expansions?,"Statham, MJ; Sacks, BN; Aubry, KB; Perrine, JD; Wisely, SM","Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are native to boreal and western montane portions of North America but their origins are unknown in many lowland areas of the United States. Red foxes were historically absent from much of the East Coast at the time of European settlement and did not become common until the mid-1800s. Some early naturalists described an apparent southward expansion of native foxes that coincided with anthropogenic habitat changes in the region. Alternatively, red foxes introduced from Europe during Colonial times may have become established in the east and subsequently expanded their range westward. The red fox also was absent historically from most lowland areas of the western United States. Extant populations of red foxes in those areas are considered to have arisen from intentional introductions from the east (and by extension are putatively European), escapes or releases from fur farms, or range expansions by native populations. To test these hypotheses we compared mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome b and D-loop) from 110 individuals from 6 recently established populations to 327 native (primarily historical) individuals from Eurasia, Alaska, Canada, the northeastern United States, and montane areas in the western contiguous United States, and to 38 individuals from fur farms. We found no Eurasian haplotypes in North America, but found native haplotypes in recently established populations in the southeastern United States and in parts of the western United States. Red foxes from the southeastern United States were closely related to native populations in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States, suggesting that they originated from natural range expansions, not from translocation of European lineages, as was widely believed prior to this study. Similarly, recently established populations in the Great Basin and in western Oregon originated primarily from native populations in western montane regions, but also contained a few nonnative North American haplotypes. In contrast, populations in western Washington and southern California contained nonnative, highly admixed stock that clearly resulted from intracontinental translocations. Several common haplotypes in these populations originated in regions where fur-farm stocks originated. Although European red foxes translocated to the eastern United States during Colonial times may have contributed genetically to extant populations in that region, our findings suggest that most of the matrilineal ancestry of eastern red foxes originated in North America.",wisely@ufl.edu,2012,10.1644/11-MAMM-A-033.1,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,historical-dna,EG,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,check for fit; RC: reject bc no temporal comparisons,,,,,,,,,,

We used noninvasive genetic analyses to obtain ecological and genetic data on the last remaining Far Eastern leopard population in the world. During seven winters from 2000-2001 to 2007-2008, we collected feces, hair, and saliva from most of the leopard habitat. Of the 239 leopard samples collected during the study period, 155 were successfully genotyped at 13 microsatellite loci and 37 individuals (18 males and 19 females) were identified. Population size estimates based on the Capwire model were 28 (95 % CI 19-38) in 2002-03 and 26 (95 % CI 13-33) in 2007-2008. The leopard population had a low level of genetic diversity (expected and observed heterozygosity = 0.43; average number of alleles per locus = 2.62), and effective population size was estimated to be low (N (e) = 7-16) by two genetic-based methods. We observed little improvement in the genetic diversity during the study period and did find an indication of allele loss compared with individuals from the mid-1990s, suggesting that the remaining population will continue to suffer loss of genetic diversity. Given the small population size and the low genetic diversity, with little expectation of replenishment of the genetic variation by natural immigration, successful expansion of available habitat and development of a second population based on captive individuals may be crucial for persistence of this leopard subspecies in the wild.",tasugi@ees.hokudai.ac.jp,2014,10.1007/s10592-013-0558-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,EG,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,Russia,Southwest Primorskii Krai,"2007.01.01,2002.01.01","18,23",2,2002.01.01,2007.01.01,1095,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,,chronic,microsat,fecal,frozen,GuSCN/silica method,Sanger,PCR,"20-30 years between samples.

Baetis tricaudatus belongs to the Baetis rhodani species group, which is known to have cryptic species. Some investigators have found that B. tricaudatus morphospecies have cytochrome oxidase I (COI) diversity >20%. However, no investigators have examined whether this diversity is structured temporally, with some haplotypes being more common in certain years or seasons than others. We sequenced COI from 371 B. rhodani specimens. The 371 rhodani species group sequences generated fell into 2 well-supported clades, one with 38 Baetis adonis specimens and another with 333 B. tricaudatus specimens, which were the focus of our study. We examined the temporal and spatial dynamics of genetic diversity in B. tricaudatus populations from northern California using COI haplotype networks. The maximum genetic diversity among B. tricaudatus specimens was 1.7% and was found at a single site (Austin Creek). The same 2 dominant haplotypes of B. tricaudatus were consistent through years, sites, and seasons, and Phi(ST) values were correspondingly low. In 2 intensive sampling events, each with >40 individuals examined, intrapopulational divergence was 1.2 to 1.4%. This result suggests that most of the genetic diversity for this species in this system could be captured in 1 high-effort sampling event rather than in smaller, long-term monitoring events.

It has established a large population in its new region, shortly after arriving to the Mediterranean. In the present study, the mitochondrial DNA D-loop (control region) of Red Sea specimens of N. randalli was compared to that of specimens from the Mediterranean. A pronounced decrease in genetic variability was observed in the Mediterranean fish, indicating a bottleneck effect. Ten different haplotypes were found among 14 Red Sea specimens, while only six haplotypes were found among 42 Mediterranean specimens. The Simpson's Index of Diversity was significantly larger for the Red Sea than for the Mediterranean fish. In addition, the average genetic distance between any pair of individuals was significantly lower in the Mediterranean samples (4.526 x 10(-3)) than that of the Red Sea samples (6.239 x 10(-3)).

As an alternative, we use shotgun metagenomic sequencing from mixed pools of DNA, from which mitochondrial sequences are filtered in silico. We extracted DNA from a single leg of 35 species of British butterflies that had been stored in the Natural History Museum for between 9 and 35 years. Illumina MiSeq (1/3 of flow cell) produced mitogenome sequences of > 10 kb for ten species, of which six were (almost) complete. In addition, full or partial barcode sequences for 31 species were recovered, which, in almost all cases, showed perfect (100%) identity to sequences available in the BOLD database under the same taxon name. The mean length of sequence reads was 167 bp (putative mitochondrial reads) and 153 bp (all reads). Assembly of contigs > 10 kb from these short reads was apparently error free, except in the case of two closely-related species of Pieris that formed chimeras. Contiguous sequences are difficult to obtain from degraded DNA with Sanger technology but the Illumina short reads are a natural fit for dry-collection specimens. The obvious possibility for scaling up this protocol provides exciting prospects for the large-scale indexing of natural history collections using partial or full mitochondrial genomes.

In this article, we explored whether Japanese elvers have temporal genetic structure and whether the population went through population expansion during the Pleistocene. In total, 273 specimens were collected from the Tanshui River estuary, northern Taiwan, in 1989-2008. The highly variable region of the mitochondrial DNA D-loop was cloned and sequenced. A genealogy was reconstructed based on the Neighbor-joining method, and results showed an unobvious yearly clade and a high level of haplotype diversity, but low mean nucleotide diversity among samples. Most of the pairwise F (ST) appeared statistically insignificant. These genetic parameters suggested a lack of temporal population structure combined with a sustainable high effective population size of Japanese eels. Negative values of Tajima's D and Fu's F (s) appeared in all samples with high significance. The mismatch distribution, skyline plot, and minimum spanning network indicated that historical population expansion of the Japanese eel could be traced back to the Pleistocene.

However, our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of hybridization that erode versus promote species boundaries is incomplete. The endangered, endemic koloa maoli (or Hawaiian duck, Anas wyvilliana) is thought to be threatened with genetic extinction through ongoing hybridization with an introduced congener, the feral mallard (A. platyrhynchos). We investigated spatial and temporal variation in hybrid prevalence in populations throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, using genomic data to characterize population structure of koloa, quantify the extent of hybridization, and compare hybrid proportions over time. To accomplish this, we genotyped 3,308 double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) loci in 425 putative koloa, mallards, and hybrids from populations across the main Hawaiian Islands. We found that despite a population decline in the last century, koloa genetic diversity is high. There were few hybrids on the island of KauaModified Letter Turned Commai, home to the largest population of koloa. By contrast, we report that sampled populations outside of KauaModified Letter Turned Commai can now be characterized as hybrid swarms, in that all individuals sampled were of mixed koloa x mallard ancestry. Further, there is some evidence that these swarms are stable over time. These findings demonstrate spatial variation in the extent and consequences of interspecific hybridization, and highlight how islands or island-like systems with small population sizes may be especially prone to genetic extinction when met with a congener that is not reproductively isolated.",caitlin.wells@rams.colostate.edu,2019,10.1111/mec.15286,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,museum-dna,JW,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,,,,yes,other,Aves,Hawaii,"Hanalei,Kii,Hamakua,Kanaha","2003.01.01,2013.01.01","126.19.7.6,29.16.56.4",2,2003.01.01,2013.01.01,1460,pre-designed,anthropogenic,invasive_species,,,chronic,SNP,blood,NA,Qiagen,Illumina_HiSeq,RAD,"only temporal comparison was hybridization rates so not recording div stats; lat long provided in paper (supplemental material); 2003 represents 1998-2007, 2013 represents 2011-2015; generation time (for mallards) estimated from Lavretsky et al.

Seventeen individuals found in marine habitats at six localities and six nests laid at three nesting sites were sampled along the Mexican Pacific. Our results show five haplotypes of 766 bp, three previously identified and two that to date were not reported. Genetic diversity indices indicate moderate to low variation for this region. Even with the small sample size reported here, our results show important relationships between the Mexican Pacific hawksbills and nesting populations of Central America and foraging areas along the Eastern and Indo-Pacific.

Unlike the island fox (Urocyon littoralis) and island subspecies of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), the island spotted skunk shows no morphological differentiation between islands and is differentiated only weakly from mainland subspecies, suggesting recent colonization. However, the islands have been isolated from each other and the mainland throughout the Quaternary Period. We used 8 microsatellite loci to investigate the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations of spotted skunks from 8 localities (the 2 islands and 6 mainland localities), representing 4 subspecies. Tissue samples were obtained from 66 fresh specimens collected from 2000 to 2002 and 142 museum specimens collected from 1906 to 1994. Allelic richness and heterozygosity in island spotted skunk populations was approximately 30% lower than that found in mainland localities or subspecies. All localities or subspecies were significantly differentiated (mean F-ST was 0.17 and 0.13 for localities and subspecies, respectively). Contrary to comparisons based on morphological data, genetic differentiation was especially strong between islands and between island and mainland localities or subspecies. Patterns of differentiation suggest that skunks colonized the Channel Islands shortly before rising sea levels separated Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands (11,500 years ago). Our results indicate that the taxonomic status of the island spotted skunk should be reconsidered and that both island populations might constitute evolutionarily significant units worthy of conservation.",floydch@uwec.edu,2011,10.1644/09-MAMM-A-204.1,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,museum-dna,JW,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,USA,West coast,"1980.01.01,1927.01.01","113,99",2,1927.01.01,1980.01.01,365,opportunistic,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,microsat,skin,dried,GenElute,Sanger,PCR,"only recording results from full dataset (not Santa Rosa Island bc subset of full dataset and showed same pattern); 1980 represents 1961-2000, 1927 represnts 1906-1949; generation time (age of first breeding) estimated from: https://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/eastern-spotted-skunk","Ho,He,allelic richness","TFPGA,FSTAT",,8,,,small,no change in diversity over time frame,,

To assess the impact of this intensive local harvest we compared historic and contemporary samples. We explored 2 models of repopulation for this region. In the recovery model animals not hunted by Peary were the source of the current population. In the recolonization model animals from adjacent regions contributed to the current population. A genetic assessment of mitochondria] DNA (mtDNA) diversity comparing historic specimens (n = 12) to contemporary samples from the same region (n = 22) indicates the loss of I major mtDNA haplogroup. In this region historic and contemporary samples were significantly differentiated from one another. Combined mtDNA (n = 121) and 9 nuclear DNA loci (n = 151) indicate that the contemporary NE animals are most similar to those in adjacent regions to the south. We interpret this as supporting our recolonization model and suggest that, following Peary, animals dispersed north from central Ellesmere. Animals from the region to the west (NW) of NE showed the greatest differentiation from all other regions, suggesting that although proximate in distance, movement between the NW and NE might always have been limited. The NW region was unique in that it contained 1 predominant mtDNA haplotype at high frequency (0.88), the lowest observed heterozygosity (H(o) = 0.50), and the highest mean relatedness (R = 0.063). Our combined results highlight the sensitivity of populations at the range limit to stochastic events and the potential limits to recovery following significant perturbations.

1675,,Parental and hybrid Daphnia from the D.longispina complex: long-term dynamics in genetic structure and significance of overwintering modes,"Griebel, J; Giessler, S; Yin, M; Wolinska, J","In recent decades, hybridization has become a focus of attention because of its role in evolutionary processes. However, little is known about changes in genetic structure within and between parental species and hybrids over time. Here, we studied processes of genetic change in parental species and hybrids from the Daphnia longispina complex (Crustacea, Cladocera) over a period of six years across ten habitats. These cyclical parthenogens respond to fluctuating environments by switching from asexual to sexual reproduction. Importantly, sexually produced diapausing eggs, which resist extreme conditions such as low temperatures and serve as dispersal stages, are produced to a lower extent by hybrids. Long-term microsatellite data revealed clear differences between hybrids and parental species. In hybrids, clonal diversity values were lower, whereas heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium values were higher compared to parental species. Clonal diversity of hybrids responded to the strength of the winter, with cold winters resulting in few genotypes in the following spring. In time windows when only asexual hybrid females survive, priority effects will favour the establishment of the hybrid offspring before hatchlings from parental diapause eggs can enter the community. The constant high levels of heterozygosity maintained by clonal reproduction in hybrids might lead to their successful establishment over time, when they are able to escape competition from both parental species. Although we found evidence that hybrids diversity depends on fluctuating environments, a direct link between hybrid abundance and the strength of winter was missing. Because of reduced adaptability in clonally reproducing hybrids, multiple factors must contribute to promoting their long-term success in fluctuating environments.",griebel@igb-berlin.de,2016,10.1111/jeb.12828,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KC,KF,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,yes,freshwater,Branchiopoda,Germany,"Fasaneriesee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Waldschwaigsee, Fasaneriesee.FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Lusssee.OlchingerSee.Waldschwaigsee, BohmerWeiher.Fasaneriesee.FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Lusssee.OlchingerSee.Waldschwaigsee, FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.Waldschwaigsee, FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.Waldschwaigsee, BohmerWeiher.Fasaneriesee.FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Lusssee.OlchingerSee.Waldschwaigsee","2013.04.01, 2012.04.01, 2011.04.01, 2010.06.01, 2009.05.01, 2008.07.01","40.69.72.81.49.51, 74.54.72.70.77.92.80.82.80, 16.93.92.90.94.88.92.50.92.88, 188.84.88, 171.86.87, 91.89.168.74.91.92.87.93.47.171","4,6",2008.07.01,2013.04.01,5,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,acute,microsat,NA,NA,"Brede_etal_2006, Yin_etal_2010",NA,PCR,"Table with sample sizes does not define abbreviations, so I added N1+N2 for all species/hybrids to get sample size for each site/year (methods mention they sampled at 2 sites in each pond), generation time from https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Dappu1/Dappu1.home.html, no info in paper on extraction/preservation/tissue sampled but this is not needed anyways as these are not historical samples",,,,,,,,,,
1308,,"Effective size and genetic composition of two exploited, migratory whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus lavaretus) populations","McCairns, RJS; Kuparinen, A; Panda, B; Jokikokko, E; Merila, J","Large scale harvesting and other anthropogenic activities have caused severe population declines in many commercially important fish populations, but accurate information about census and effective population size is often hard to come by. Available evidence suggests that in marine fishes, effective population size (N-e) is often several orders of magnitude smaller than census size, such that intensively harvested populations may be particularly vulnerable to loss of genetic diversity. The European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) has a long history of heavy exploitation in the Baltic Sea, and the Finnish commercial catch of the species has been substantially reduced, despite high fishing effort. We investigated the temporal genetic stability of migratory whitefish populations from two Finnish rivers (Tornionjoki and Kiiminkijoki), sampled at least twice between 1981 and 2006, by assaying variability in 21 microsatellite loci. Our results suggest a small, albeit significant (F-ST = 0.004; p = 0.008) and temporally stable, degree of differentiation between rivers. However, in contrast to earlier reports, heterochronous runs (ascending groups) from Tornionjoki did not exhibit significant genetic divergence. Bayesian estimates of N-e suggest substantial declines from historic levels dating to ca 250 years. Yet despite a probable decrease in census population size over the study period, we detected no significant change in contemporary N-e. Within group genetic diversity appeared largely unchanged over this time frame; however, we detected a trend towards decreased differentiation between spawning groups (rivers) since the 1980s. These results are discussed in light of stocking programs and conservation of genetic diversity of natural populations.",scott.mccairns@helsinki.fi,2012,10.1007/s10592-012-0394-2,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,KF,RC,reject,non-wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: reject bc non-wildlife (stocked populations),,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have quantified the recent decline of numerous Lepidopteran species in the U.K., including the garden tiger moth (Arctia caja), in C which abundance has decreased by 85% over the past 30 years. At the same time that overall numbers have been falling, the distribution of abundance of this species has been moving northwards. In this study, morphological and genetic data were used to C, investigate the possibility that these changes in abundance and distribution have been accompanied by microevolutionary changes. 2. A comparison of wing size and shape in current and historical moth samples revealed that wing shape has altered significantly over the past century, resulting in longer, narrower hindwings and narrower forewings for a given forewing length. Habitat fragmentation and increased suitability of northerly sites provide a plausible explanation for the selection of increasingly dispersive individuals. 3. Mitochondrial DNA revealed no phylogeographic structuring either before or after the population decline. However, a comparison of mtDNA haplotypes from current and museum specimens indicated that the recent population decline across the U.K. has been accompanied by a significant loss of genetic diversity. 4. The changes in wing shape suggest recent adaptation to environmental change, whereas a loss of genetic diversity may limit the ability of garden tiger moths to adapt to future environmental change.",joannafreelan@trentu.ca,2008,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01013.x,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,historical-dna,EG,Kyle,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,popsize,,,no,terrestrial,Insecta,UK,UK,"2002.07.01,1945.01.01","93,37",2,1945.01.01,2002.07.01,28,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,muscle,dried,Nucleospin Tissue Kit,Sanger,PCR,"This paper should be in the diversity section, no analysis of population size metrics; tissue type was an entire leg; generation time source: 10.1371/journal.pone.0152787; RC: 1945 represents midpoint of 1920-1971 range",,,,,,,,,,

The landlocked population of currently less than 300 ringed seals inhabiting Lake Saimaa in southeastern Finland offers a unique model for studying these questions in small populations. It has remained completely isolated since the last ice age, information on its initial genetic diversity can be inferred from the large marine source population in the Baltic Sea, and its ecology is well studied. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA diversity of 215 Saimaa ringed seals spanning three decades in order to assess long- and short-term changes in the gene pool of this critically endangered subspecies. The mtDNA diversity of the Saimaa ringed seal is low, consisting of only eight haplotypes. Nevertheless, coalescent simulations show that the diversity is unexpectedly high when contrasted with the over 800 generations of isolation and the estimated historical carrying capacity of the lake. In the short term, marked temporal and spatial differentiation was observed among three decades and four regions of Lake Saimaa, suggesting extremely low effective subpopulation sizes and limited migration of females within the lake. Our study strongly suggests that enhancing gene flow and population growth is crucial for maintaining the remaining genetic diversity of the Saimaa ringed seal.",mia.valtonen@uef.fi,2012,10.1007/s10592-012-0367-5,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,KF,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,,,no,freshwater,Mammalia,Finland,Lake Saimaa,"2005.01.01,1995.01.01,1985.01.01","82,54,79",3,1985.01.01,2005.01.01,4015,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,NA,frozen,DNeasy blood and tissue kit,Sanger,PCR,"This paper should be in the diversity section, no analysis of population size metrics; 1-700bp mitochondrial region; time periods reflect mid-point of decade in which death happened (e.g. 2005 = 2010-2000 deaths, etc.)","# haplotypes,# private haplotypes,# variable sites,haplotype diversity,pi,haplotype richness,AMOVA,demographic models;cumulative haplotype diversity","ARLEQUIN,HP-RARE,BayeSSC",no,1,,,medium,low diversity BUT much higher than expected given long period of isolation -- low Ne within subpopulations and likely limited female migration throughout lake,,

Many species of marine mammals have experienced dramatic changes in abundance and distribution due to climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic impacts. However, thanks to conservation efforts, some of these species have shown remarkable population recovery and are now recolonizing their former ranges. Here, we use zooarchaeological, demographic and genetic data to examine processes of colonization, local extinction and recolonization of the two northern European grey seal subspecies inhabiting the Baltic Sea and North Sea. The zooarchaeological and genetic data suggest that the two subspecies diverged shortly after the formation of the Baltic Sea approximately 4200 years BP, probably through a gradual shift to different breeding habitats and phenologies. By comparing genetic data from 19th century pre-extinction material with that from seals currently recolonizing their past range, we observed a marked spatiotemporal shift in subspecies boundaries, with increasing encroachment of North Sea seals on areas previously occupied by the Baltic Sea subspecies. Further, both demographic and genetic data indicate that the two subspecies have begun to overlap geographically and are hybridizing in a narrow contact zone. Our findings provide new insights into the processes of colonization, extinction and recolonization and have important implications for the management of grey seals across northern Europe.",morten.olsen@snm.ku.dk,2016,10.1111/mec.13748,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,RC,RC,accept,accept,empirical,diversity,connectivity,popsize,,yes,marine,Mammalia,"UK,Denmark,Sweden,Germany,Estonia","North Sea,Kattegat,Baltic Sea,Kattegat and SW-Baltic","2005.01.01,1890.01.01","74.67.146,42",2,1890.01.01,2005.01.01,5110,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,habitat_loss,disease,chronic,mtDNA_seq,bone,NA,MinElute PCR Purification kit,Sanger,PCR,"This paper should be in the diversity section, only historical sampling included were in diversity and connectivity analyses; historical samples only have 1 mito 400bp region;RC: contemporary ranges from 1941-2013 BUT 95% of samples from 1998-2013, so using that midpoint to represent --- all sites but Kattegat & SW-Baltic site contemporary; 1890 represents midpoint of 1889-1890","# poplymorphic sites,# haplotypes,haplotype diversity,pi,AMOVA,haplotype networks","DNASP,ARLEQUIN,TEMPNET",no,1,,,medium,"looking at two grey seal subspecies -- found that North Sea subspecies is encroaching on Baltic Sea (post-Baltic Sea crash), and are likely hybridizing in the contact zone",,

To study genetic differences between populations across the range and change in genetic diversity over time, we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 67 museum specimens (years 1861-1976) as well as 39 contemporary samples from Spain and seven from Greece (years 1992-2003). In the historical sample, we found a lack of significant genetic structure between populations in different areas. We found evidence that the species experienced a rapid expansion in the past, perhaps from glacial refugia centred around the Mediterranean following the last ice age. In Spain, the population went through a dramatic bottleneck in the 1970s and early 1980s, when only a few dozens individuals remained in the wild. Although population size has since recovered to a few thousand individuals, we found a highly significant loss of mitochondrial haplotype diversity between the historical and contemporary samples.
