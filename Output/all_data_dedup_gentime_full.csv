"1",1,6855,NA,"Genetic monitoring of two decades of hybridization between allis shad (Alosa alosa) and twaite shad (Alosa fallax)","Jolly, MT; Maitland, PS; Genner, MJ","Habitat alteration has been implicated in driving hybridization between the sympatric migratory shads Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax. Morphological and molecular evidence is consistent with hybridization across the overlapping range of these species, but the temporal extent of hybrid occurrence and genetic consequences for populations have not been explored. Using eight nuclear microsatellite loci and samples collected between 1989 and 2008 in the Solway Firth (UK), we genetically identified hybrids, studied temporal changes in their frequency, and explored changes in allele frequencies of parental populations. These molecular data confirmed the hybrid status of individuals identified using morphology (number of rakers on the outer gill arch), and enabled separation of hybrids from purebred individuals. Mitochondrial cytochrome-b sequencing revealed the presence of two haplogroups, each predominantly occurring in one species. Heterospecific haplotypes were found in 22.3 and 12.8% of A. alosa and A. fallax individuals, respectively, consistent with backcrossing and suggesting that hybrids are fertile. On average, microsatellite-identified hybrids comprised 12.7% of all samples, but when individuals with cytonuclear discordance were also considered introgressed on average 25.4% of individuals were of hybrid ancestry. Overall, allelic richness remained largely unchanged within species, but there were declines in the inbreeding coefficient (F (IS)) of both species and episodes of significant temporal allelic frequency change. Hybrids sampled between 2004 and 2008 showed no evidence of lower fecundity relative to purebred individuals. Together, results suggest that hybridization between shad species in northern Europe is prevalent, and has been ongoing over at least two decades. The challenge is now to understand the extent to which observed patterns are linked to immigration from other populations, and the mechanisms that have prevented species collapse despite apparent hybrid fertility and longstanding introgression of neutral markers.","mtjolly@ymail.com",2011,"10.1007/s10592-011-0211-3","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","JW","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","diversity","connectivity","","yes","other","Actinopterygii","UK","Soloway Firth","2008.12.31-2006.0.01, 2005.12.31-2004.01.01, 1994.12.31- 1993.01.01, 1992.12.31-1991.01.01, 1990.12.31-1989.01.01",NA,1153,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","competition","env_variation","chronic","microsat","scale","dried","CTAB","Sanger","PCR","anadromous; seq_platform = megaBACE (sanger equivalent)","2008.12.31-2006.0.01",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UK","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5.70251517779705,6575,18.013698630137

However, very few studies have combined spatial and temporal sampling to investigate adaptive genetic structuring at local and microgeographical scales, i.e. scales at which neutral genetic markers have typically revealed very limited levels of population structure. In the present study we analyzed 92 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from several sampling sites within the North Sea and adjacent areas. To test for temporal stability, we included long-and short-term (i.e. from 24 to 38 and from 8 to 11 yr, respectively) temporally replicated samples from a subset of populations. As expected, we found very low levels of neutral genetic population structure (F-ST = 0.003). Three specific loci, however, showed highly elevated levels of genetic differentiation. Interestingly, these loci were identical to loci previously found to display signals of adaptive evolution on larger spatial scales. Analysis of historical samples revealed long-term temporally stable patterns of both neutral and adaptive divergence between some populations, indicating long-term temporal adaptive stability driven by strong local selection. In an environmentally dynamic area, on the other hand, patterns of genetic structuring were more variable. Overall, our results not only suggest separation of populations under both evolutionary and ecological paradigms, but also illustrate the usefulness of the spatio-temporal approach for making inferences about the dynamics and geographical distribution of adaptive genetic variation in natural populations.","jhh@aqua.dtu.dk",2011,"10.3354/meps09246","MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES","historical-dna","KF","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","connectivity","","","no","marine","Actinopterygii",NA,"57.15/11.35.56.45/07.30.57.45/05.30, 54.29/00.02.50.47/0.29, 58.00/03.00.59.58/05.15, 62.53/06.18.60.56/08.52, 57.10/08.20, 55.17/03.39, NA, NA.NA","2007.01.01, 2006.01.01, 2003.01.01, 2002.01.01, 1999.01.01, 1996.01.01, 1978.01.01, 1965.01.01","40.40.40, 40.40, 40.40, 40.40, 40, 40, 32, 33.32",2739,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","SNP","gills",NA,"chelex","Agena MassARRAY",NA,"","2007.01.01","40.40.40"," 40.40"," 40.40"," 40.40"," 40"," 40"," 32"," 33.32",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5.60058415480102,15340,42.027397260274

Reintroduction of Coho salmon to the interior Columbia River (Wenatchee River) using lower river stocks placed selective pressures on the new colonizers due to substantial differences with their original habitat such as migration distance and navigation of six additional hydropower dams. We used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to genotype 5,392 SNPs in reintroduced Coho salmon in the Wenatchee River over four generations to test for signals of temporal structure and adaptive variation. Temporal genetic structure among the three broodlines of reintroduced fish was evident among the initial return years (2000, 2001, and 2002) and their descendants, which indicated levels of reproductive isolation among broodlines. Signals of adaptive variation were detected from multiple outlier tests and identified candidate genes for further study. This study illustrated that genetic variation and structure of reintroduced populations are likely to reflect source stocks for multiple generations but may shift over time once established in nature.","camn@critfc.org",2017,"10.1002/ece3.3492","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","temporal-genetics","KF","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","connectivity","","","no","other","Actinopterygii","USA","Wenatchee River, USA","2009.01.01, 2006.01.01, 2000.01.01","37, 70, 31",1095,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","env_variation","","","chronic","SNP","scale",NA,"Qiagen","Illumina_HiSeq","RAD","","2009.01.01","37"," 70"," 31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3.0027397260274,3288,9.00821917808219

Herring spawn mostly in fall or spring, and genomic differentiation was recently detected between these groups. Here we used a subset of this differentiation, 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the temporal dynamics of this local adaptation and the applicability of SNP subsets in stock assessment. We showed remarkable temporal stability of genomic differentiation corresponding to spawning season, between samples taken a decade apart (2005 N = 90 vs. 2014 N = 71) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and new evidence of limited interbreeding between spawning components. We also examined an understudied and overexploited herring population in Bras d'Or lake (N = 97); using highly reduced SNP panels (N-SNPs > 6), we verified little-known sympatric spawning populations within this unique inland sea. These results describe consistent local adaptation, arising from asynchronous reproduction in a migratory and dynamic marine species. Our research demonstrates the efficiency and precision of SNP-based assessments of sympatric subpopulations; and indeed, this temporally stable local adaptation underlines the importance of such fine-scale management practices.","daniel.ruzzante@dal.ca",2019,"10.1002/ece3.4768","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","temporal-genomics","KF","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","connectivity","","","no","marine","Actinopterygii","Canada","Gulf of St. Lawrence","2014.10.01, 2014.04.01, 2005.10.01, 2005.04.01","47, 31, 40, 30",1228,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","SNP","scale","ethanol, frozen","phenolchloroform","Agena MassARRAY","PCR","","2014.10.01","47"," 31"," 40"," 30",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.8257328990228,3470,9.50684931506849

Using replicated transect samples collected over a 10-year interval from 2002 to 2012, we find evidence for concerted movement of genetic clines in a plateau fence lizard hybrid zone (Sceloporus tristichus) in Arizona. Cline-fitting analyses of SNP and mtDNA data both provide evidence that the hybrid zone shifted northward by approximately 2 km during the 10-year interval. For each sampling period, the mtDNA cline centre is displaced from the SNP cline centre and maintaining an introgression distance of approximately 3 km. The northward expansion of juniper trees into the Little Colorado River Basin in the early 1900s provides a plausible mechanism for hybrid zone formation and movement, and a broadscale quantification of recent land cover change provides support for increased woody species encroachment at the southern end of the hybrid zone. However, population processes can also contribute to hybrid zone movement, and the current stability of the ecotone habitats in the centre of the hybrid zone suggests that movement could decelerate in the future.","leache@uw.edu",2017,"10.1111/mec.14033","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","historical-dna","JW","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","connectivity","","","yes","terrestrial","Reptilia","USA","(lat/lon.lat/lon) 34.90371/110.18208.34.83582/110.1449.34.79292/110.09873.34.73801/110.03783.34.6678/110.0377.34.6025/110.0624.34.52789/110.08072.34.33398/110.11372

We examined the changes in the morphometric and genetic profiles of an Africanized honey bee population collected near where the original African swarms escaped, after 34 years of Africanization. Workers from colonies sampled in 1968 and in 2002 were morphometrically analyzed using relative warps analysis and an Automatic Bee Identification System (ABIS). All the colonies had their mitochondrial DNA identified. The subspecies that mixed to form the Africanized honey bees were used as a comparison for the morphometric analysis. The two morphometric approaches showed great similarity of Africanized bees with the African subspecies, Apis mellifera scutellata, corroborating with other markers. We also found the population of 1968 to have the pattern of wing venation to be more similar to A. m. scutellata than the current population. The mitochondrial DNA of European origin, which was very common in the 1968 population, was not found in the current population, indicating selective pressure replacing the European with the African genome in this tropical region. Both morphometric methodologies were very effective in discriminating the A. mellifera groups; the non-linear analysis of ABIS was the most successful in identifying the bees, with more than 94% correct classifications.","tfrancoy@rge.fmrp.usp.br",2009,"10.4238/vol8-2kerr019","GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH","temporal-genetics","JW","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","connectivity","","","no","terrestrial","Insecta","Brazil","Ribeirão Preto (21° 10’S 47° 51’W) ","2002.01.01, 1968.01.01","18, 18",12,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","invasive_species","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin","dried","CTAB",NA,"PCR","","2002.01.01","18"," 18",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Brazil",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1034.91666666667,12419,34.0246575342466

We here address these issues with a series of genome scans in four overfished populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) studied over an 80-year period. Screening of >1000 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 77 loci that showed highly elevated levels of differentiation, likely as an effect of directional selection, in either time, space or both. Exploratory analysis suggested that temporal allele frequency shifts at certain loci may correlate with local temperature variation and with life history changes suggested to be fisheries induced. Interestingly, however, largely nonoverlapping sets of loci were temporal outliers in the different populations and outliers from the 1928 to 1960 period showed almost complete stability during later decades. The contrasting microevolutionary trajectories among populations resulted in sequential shifts in spatial outliers, with no locus maintaining elevated spatial differentiation throughout the study period. Simulations of migration coupled with observations of temporally stable spatial structure at neutral loci suggest that population replacement or gene flow alone could not explain all the observed allele frequency variation. Thus, the genetic changes are likely to at least partly be driven by highly dynamic temporally and spatially varying selection. These findings have important implications for our understanding of local adaptation and evolutionary potential in high gene flow organisms and underscore the need to carefully consider all dimensions of biocomplexity for evolutionarily sustainable management.","nthe@stanford.edu",2013,"10.1111/mec.12260","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","ancient-dna","KJ","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","diversity","","","no","marine","Actinopterygii","Canada","3NO.3Ps.4VsW, 4T, 4T, 3Ps, 3NO, 4T, 4T, 3NO, 4T, 3Ps, 4VsW, 4T.3NO, 4T","2010.01.01, 2008.01.01, 2002.01.01, 1993.01.01, 1990.01.01, 1983.01.01, 1976.01.01, 1973.01.01, 1968.01.01, 1964.01.01, 1961.01.01, 1960.01.01, 1928.01.01","32.26.22, 39, 29, 25, 37, 37, 50, 37, 31, 33, 16, 37.28, 29",2737.5,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","env_variation","","chronic","SNP","bone","dried","omega","Illumina_HiSeq","PCR","4T, 3NO, 3Ps, and 4VsW are Northwest Atlantic Fishery Organization(NAFO) management areas for cod","2010.01.01","32.26.22"," 39"," 29"," 25"," 37"," 37"," 50"," 37"," 31"," 33"," 16"," 37.28"," 29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.94100456621,29951,82.0575342465753

Polymorphism in the couch potato gene has been implicated in genetic variation for this diapause trait. Using a collection of 20 populations from Florida to Canada and 11 collections from 3 years in a Pennsylvania orchard, we estimated the allele frequencies for 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the couch potato gene. These include the specific polymorphism associated with diapause inducability. We find that the SNP polymorphism, 48034(A/T), is correlated with latitude and its frequencies are predicted by the incidence of diapause trait. We find that the clinal patterns for cpo SNPs sampled in 1997 are similar to the same SNPs sampled in 2009-2010. SNPs that show apparent associations with cpo expression are also clinal with the low-expression allele increasing in frequency, as would be predicted from functional knockout studies of cpo. Finally, we see a significant pattern where the frequency of the diapause-causing allele drops in frequency during the summer season, consistent with the drop in the incidence of the diapause trait. The selection required to drive this response is large, roughly 24% to 59% per generation depending on the degree of dominance.","walter.eanes@stonybrook.edu",2014,"10.1111/evo.12291","EVOLUTION","temporal-genetics","JW","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Insecta","Canada,USA","Media(PA), Hahira(GA), Churchville(MD).Jacksonville(FL), Charlottesville(VA), Venus(FL), Smithfield(NC).Homestead(FL), Eutawville(SC), Bowdoin(ME).Putney(VT), Shoreham(VT).Marion(NY).Newark(NY).Harvard(MA).Middlefield(CT), Riverhead(NY), Sudbury(ON), Princeton(NJ), Raleigh(NC)","2011.11.01-2009.06.01, 2010.11.01, 2010.10.01, 2010.09.01, 2010.08.01, 2010.07.01, 2010.06.01, 2009.10.01, 2009.09.01, 2009.08.01, 2009.08.01-2008.08.01, 2009.06.01, 2005.08.01",NA,21,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","SNP","skin","ethanol",NA,"454-pyrosequencing",NA,"num.sampled and extract_method NA","2011.11.01-2009.06.01",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada","USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,108.714285714286,2283,6.25479452054795

Hybrid zones between two poeciliid fishes, Xiphophorus birchmanni and X. malinche, occur in multiple tributaries with independent replication of upstream-to-downstream gradients in morphology and allele frequencies. Ecological niche modelling revealed that temperature is a central predictive factor in the spatial distribution of pure parental species and their hybrids and explains spatial and temporal variation in the frequency of neutral genetic markers in hybrid populations. Among populations of parentals and hybrids, both thermal tolerance and heat-shock protein expression vary strongly, indicating that spatial and temporal structure is likely driven by adaptation to local thermal environments. Therefore, hybrid zone structure is strongly influenced by interspecific differences in physiological mechanisms for coping with the thermal environment.","zculumber@gmail.com",2012,"10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02562.x","JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","temporal-genetics","AAS","ACS","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","","","","yes","terrestrial","Actinopterygii","Mexico","Calnali(mid), Apantla.Calnali(mid).Xochicoatlán.Tlatemaco, Xochicoatlán, Aguazarca, Xochicoatlán, Aguazarca, Aguazarca, Xochicoatlán, Xochicoatlán, Xochicoatlán, Aguazarca, Papatlatla, Xochicoatlán, SanPedro.Tlatemaco, Calnali(high).Calnali(low).Calnali(mid), Tula, Apantla, SanPedro, Aguazarca, Calnali(mid), Xochicoatlán, Papatlatla, Tula, Calnali(low), Apantla, Calnali(high).Calnali(mid)","2010.01.01, 2009.06.01, 2009.5.28, 2009.5.26, 2009.03.14, 2009.03.13, 2008.11.21, 2008.11.20, 2008.09.11, 2008.05.29, 2008.05.28, 2008.03.10, 2007.06.14, 2007.06.13, 2007.06.01, 2007.05.17, 2006.06.28, 2006.06.18, 2005.12.01, 2005.11.12, 2005.06.14, 2005.06.01, 2005.04.17, 2004.03.01, 2003.04.19, 2003.04.14",NA,304,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","acute","SNP","fin","ethanol","Qiagen",NA,"PCR","num.samped = NA","2010.01.01",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mexico",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8.07236842105263,2454,6.72328767123288

This is the second example of the CHDZ-1 gene being correlated with fitness, a previous study having established that Moorhens Gallinula chloropus carrying the rare Z* allele have reduced survival. In Godwits, however, carriers of the Z* allele (374 bp) fared better than those with the more frequent Z allele (378 bp) with respect to body mass, plumage ornamentation, reproductive parameters and habitat quality. The Z* allele was found in 14% of 251 adult birds from nature reserves, but was absent from 33 birds breeding in intensively managed agricultural lands. Males and females with the Z* allele had less extensive breeding plumage, and females had a higher body mass, bred earlier and had larger eggs. There were no significant differences in annual survival between birds with and without the Z* allele. DNA isolated from museum skins demonstrated that this polymorphism was present at low frequency in 1929. We speculate that strong asymmetrical overdominance may explain the low frequency of the Z* allele and that genetic linkage to causal genes might be an explanation for the phenotypic correlations. Our findings suggest a degree of cryptic genetic population structuring in the Dutch Godwit population.","julia.schroeder@gmail.com",2010,"10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.01005.x","IBIS","historical-dna","AAS","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","","","","no","terrestrial","Aves","Netherlands","Friesland","2007.01.01, 1931.01.01","284, 34",2190,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","nuclear_seq","skin","dried","Walsh_etal_1991, Baker_etal_2005",NA,"PCR","Generation time from HELCOM Red List Bird Expert Group 2013","2007.01.01","284"," 34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12.6753424657534,27759,76.0520547945205

Several hundreds of endemic species have evolved in each of the lakes over the past several thousands to a few millions years. Sexual selection via colour-assortative mating has often been proposed as a probable causal factor for initiating and maintaining reproductive isolation. Here, we report the consequences of human-mediated admixis among differentially coloured populations of the endemic cichlid fish Tropheus moorii from several localities that have accidentally been put in sympatry in a small harbour bay in the very south of Lake Tanganyika. We analysed the phenotypes (coloration) and genotypes (mitochondrial control region and five microsatellite loci) of almost 500 individuals, sampled over 3 consecutive years. Maximum-likelihood-based parenthood analyses and Bayesian inference of population structure revealed that significantly more juveniles are the product of within-colour-morph matings than could be expected under the assumption of random mating. Our results clearly indicate a marked degree of assortative mating with respect to the different colour morphs. Therefore, we postulate that sexual selection based on social interactions and female mate choice has played an important role in the formation and maintenance of the different colour morphs in Tropheus, and is probably common in other maternally mouthbrooding cichlids as well.","walter.salzburger@uni-konstanz.de",2006,"10.1098/rspb.2005.3321","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","museum-dna","AAS","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","","","","yes","freshwater","Actinopterygii","Zambia","Mpulungu","2001.02.01, 2000.02.01, 1999.02.01","150, 189, 118",621,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","acute","mtDNA_seq","skin","ethanol","Bruford_etal_1998",NA,"PCR","Both mtDNA and microsats.

But disease can also act as a selective pressure on survivors, driving the evolution of resistance or tolerance. Bat white-nose syndrome (WNS) is a rapidly spreading wildlife disease in North America. The fungus causing the disease invades skin tissues of hibernating bats, resulting in disruption of hibernation behavior, premature energy depletion, and subsequent death. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate changes in allele frequencies within a population of Myotis lucifugus in eastern North America to search for genetic resistance to WNS. Our results show low F-ST values within the population across time, i.e., prior to WNS (Pre-WNS) compared to the population that has survived WNS (Post-WNS). However, when dividing the population with a geographical cut-off between the states of Pennsylvania and New York, a sharp increase in values on scaffold GL429776 is evident in the Post-WNS samples. Genes present in the diverged area are associated with thermoregulation and promotion of brown fat production. Thus, although WNS may not have subjected the entire M. lucifugus population to selective pressure, it may have selected for specific alleles in Pennsylvania through decreased gene flow within the population. However, the persistence of remnant sub-populations in the aftermath of WNS is likely due to multiple factors in bat life history.","thomas.lilley@helsinki.fi",2020,"10.1534/g3.119.400966","G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS","historical-dna","ACS","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","Pennsylvania.NewYork, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.NewYork, Pennsylvania","2016.01.01, 2015.01.01, 2007.01.01, 2006.01.01","82.57, 28, 4.24, 25",730,"opportunistic","natural","disease","","","acute","nuclear_seq","skin","ethanol, frozen","QIAmp DNA Mini Kits","Illumina_HiSeq","Whole_genome","","2016.01.01","82.57"," 28"," 4.24"," 25",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5.0027397260274,3652,10.0054794520548

Both the prevalence of fluctuating selection and its relevance for evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood however, especially on contemporary timescales: unbiased empirical estimates of variation in selection are scarce, and the question of how much of the variation in selection translates into variation in genetic change has largely been ignored. Using long-term individual-based data for a wild rodent population, we quantify the magnitude of fluctuating selection on body size. Subsequently, we estimate the evolutionary dynamics of size and test for a link between fluctuating selection and evolution. We show that, over the past 11years, phenotypic selection on body size has fluctuated significantly. However, the strength and direction of genetic change have remained largely constant over the study period; that is, the rate of genetic change was similar in years where selection favoured heavier vs. lighter individuals. This result suggests that over shorter timescales, fluctuating selection does not necessarily translate into fluctuating evolution. Importantly however, individual-based simulations show that the correlation between fluctuating selection and fluctuating evolution can be obscured by the effect of drift, and that substantially more data are required for a precise and accurate estimate of this correlation. We identify new challenges in measuring the coupling between selection and evolution, and provide methods and guidelines to overcome them.","timotheebonnetc@gmail.com",2018,"10.1111/jeb.13246","JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","temporal-genetics","BR","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Switzerland","Chur","2016.07.01, 2015.07.01, 2014.07.01, 2013.07.01, 2012.07.01, 2011.07.01, 2010.07.01, 2009.07.01, 2008.07.01, 2007.07.01, 2006.07.01","128, 118, 130, 116, 66, 56, 131, 163, 139, 193, 183",365,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat","skin","ethanol, frozen",NA,NA,"PCR","not sure if this fits - using microsats and mtDNA to create a pedigree for quantitative genetic analysis.","2016.07.01","128"," 118"," 130"," 116"," 66"," 56"," 131"," 163"," 139"," 193"," 183",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.0082191780822,3653,10.0082191780822

However, most studies to date have overlooked the potential role of immigration of fish with different phenotypes as an alternative plausible mechanism behind observed phenotypic trends. Here, we investigated the evolutionary consequences of intensive fishing simultaneously at phenotypic and molecular level in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) population in the Baltic Sea over a 24-year period. We detected marked changes in size- and age-distributions and increase in juvenile growth rate. We also observed reduction of age at sexual maturity in males that has frequently been considered to support the hypothesis of fisheries-induced evolution. However, combined individual-based life-history and genetic analyses indicated increased immigration of foreign individuals with different life-history patterns as an alternative mechanism behind the observed phenotypic change. This study demonstrates the value of combining genetic and phenotypic analyses and suggests that replacement or breakdown of locally adapted gene complexes may play important role in impeding the recovery of fish populations.","lilian.pukk@emu.ee",2013,"10.1111/eva.12060","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","KC","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","Estonia","Paslepa.Haapsalu.MatsaluBay.Virtsu.ParnuBay, MatsaluBay, MatsaluBay, MatsaluBay, MatsaluBay, MatsaluBay, MatsaluBay, MatsaluBay.ParnuBay","2010.05.22, 2009.05.22, 2000.05.22, 1996.05.22, 1993.05.22, 1990.05.22, 1988.05.22, 1987.05.22","19.19.100.24.52, 73, 76, 102, 102, 100, 201, 104.52",730,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","chronic","microsat","scale","ethanol","Swatdipong_etal_2010",NA,"PCR","Generation time from Weagle and Baxter 1974","2010.05.22","19.19.100.24.52"," 73"," 76"," 102"," 102"," 100"," 201"," 104.52",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Estonia","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11.5082191780822,8401,23.0164383561644

We sequenced complete mtDNA ND2 gene 11041 bp) for 168 Common Murres sampled from seven breeding colonies across Alaska before the 2004 die-off and 127 dead murres washed ashore during the die-off. We found little mtDNA variation and lack of geographical structuring among the seven Common Murre breeding colonies in Alaska. A comparison of the single-dominant mtDNA haplotype's frequency between live murres sampled on breeding colonies before the die-off (73.2%; 95% confidence interval 66.3-79.9%) and dead murres sampled during the die-off (59.1%; 95% confidence interval 50.4-67.4%; Fisher's exact P=0.01) showed that carriers of the dominant haplotype were significantly less likely to die than carriers of other haplotypes. At the same time, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions did not differ between live (10:35) and dead birds (18:34; Fisher's exact P=0.26), indicating that non-synonymous substitutions were as likely to be eliminated as synonymous substitutions.

The aim of this study was to use spatiotemporal genetic and demographic surveys to reveal the microevolutionary forces acting on the metapopulation dynamics of the freshwater snail Biomphalaria pfeifferi. We also analyzed the consequences of population turnover on temporal genetic differentiation, an aspect that has been little explored. Genetic drift was revealed by both the demographic survey, which indicated severe bottlenecks or extinction during the rainy (resp. dry) season in open (resp. closed) habitats, and the genetic approach, which indicated high selfing rates and strong temporal differentiation. Genetic reassignments and temporal differentiation both confirmed the results of the demographic survey, which suggests that migration occurs in closed (resp. open) habitats during the hot and dry (resp. rainy) season, and indicated that source-sink functioning may be envisaged. A propagule pool mode of colonization was inferred in the open habitats during the rainy season and a migrant pool in the closed habitats during the dry season. Our study also suggests that selection might be inferred from patterns of neutral genetic markers when recombination is limited.","nathalie.charbonnel@cefe.cnrs-mop.fr; quesnoit@ensam.inra.fr; schisto@dts.mg; bremond@dts.mg; philippe.jarne@cefe.cnrs-mop.fr",2002,"10.1086/343875","AMERICAN NATURALIST","temporal-genetics","KJ","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","popsize","diversity","","no","freshwater","Gastropoda","Madagascar","Morafeno.Nanrena2.Nanarena3.Ivaro1.Ivaro2.ItasyM.ItasyC, Morafeno.Nanrena2.Nanarena3.Ivaro1.Ivaro2,  Morafeno.Nanrena2.Nanarena3.Ivaro1.Ivaro2.ItasyM.ItasyC, Morafeno.Nanarena3.Ivaro1.ItasyM, Morafeno","2000.10.01, 2000.05.01, 1999.10.01, 1999.05.01, 1998.11.01","21.24.24.14.8.24.24, 24.24.21.22.3, 19.19.21.7.20.13.26, 20.20.22.20, 19",93.5,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","natural_disaster","","acute","microsat",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PCR","Gen time reported in the paper with the citation from Dillon 2000","2000.10.01","21.24.24.14.8.24.24"," 24.24.21.22.3"," 19.19.21.7.20.13.26"," 20.20.22.20"," 19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Madagascar",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7.48663101604278,700,1.91780821917808

In spite of the continued interest in the genetics of invasive species, little attention has been paid toward the microevolutionary processes that drive structure and fate of ascidian populations over time under chemically polluted conditions. Understanding the interplay between environmental and population dynamics is critical to predict the biodiversity of marine coastal ecosystems. In the present study, a local population of the ascidian Ciona robusta living in the Fusaro Lagoon has been monitored over a 13-month period of sampling. Physico-chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, heavy metals), genetic composition (microsatellites, ITS-2), abundance and biomass (wet and dry weight) were assessed with the aim to infer fine-scale temporal variation of population structure with respect to rapid environmental change. Analysis of biomass showed that C. robusta is highly sensitive to salinity and oxygen concentrations. Further, genetic analysis suggested a highly dynamic population structure, likely due to the strong clustering of temporal samples and distinct responses to environmental conditions, including bio-accumulation of heavy metals. Here, we hypothesize that rapid variation in allele frequencies of neutral markers in C. robusta populations may increase the ability of the species to colonize habitats that are subject to strong variation and are under heavy human pressure.","caputi@szn.it; paoio.sordino@szn.it",2019,"10.1111/maec.12543","MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE","temporal-genetics","KJ","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","","","","no","marine","Ascidiacea","Italy","FusaroLagoon","2012.06.01, 2012.05.01, 2012.04.01, 2012.03.01, 2012.02.01, 2011.12.01, 2011.11.01, 2011.10.01, 2011.09.01, 2011.08.01, 2011.07.01, 2011.06.01, 2011.05.01","99.54.25.112.87.48.104.23.23.47.34.43.70",90,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","env_variation","","","acute","microsat",NA,"ethanol, frozen",NA,NA,"PCR","Total number of samples reported for 3 locations, not sure this paper is looking at adaptation","2012.06.01","99.54.25.112.87.48.104.23.23.47.34.43.70",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Italy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4.41111111111111,397,1.08767123287671

In lakes on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (off western Canada), stickleback have undergone a remarkable local radiation and show phenotypic diversity matching that seen throughout the species distribution. To provide a historical context for this radiation, we surveyed genetic variation at >1000single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in stickleback from over 100 populations. SNPs included markers evenly distributed throughout genome and candidate SNPs tagging adaptive genomic regions. Based on evenly distributed SNPs, the phylogeographic pattern differs substantially from the disjunct pattern previously observed between two highly divergent mtDNA lineages. The SNP tree instead shows extensive within watershed population clustering and different watersheds separated by short branches deep in the tree. These data are consistent with separate colonizations of most watersheds, despite underlying genetic connections between some independent drainages. This supports previous suppositions that morphological diversity observed between watersheds has been shaped independently, with populations exhibiting complete loss of lateral plates and giant size each occurring in several distinct clades. Throughout the archipelago, we see repeated selection of SNPs tagging candidate freshwater adaptive variants at several genomic regions differentiated between marinefreshwater populations on a global scale (e.g. EDA, Na/K ATPase). In estuarine sites, both marine and freshwater allelic variants were commonly detected. We also found typically marine alleles present in a few freshwater lakes, especially those with completely plated morphology. These results provide a general model for postglacial colonization of freshwater habitat by sticklebacks and illustrate the tremendous potential of genome-wide SNP data sets hold for resolving patterns and processes underlying recent adaptive divergences.","bruce.deagle@aad.gov.au",2013,"10.1111/mec.12215","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","historical-dna","KJ","KF","accept","accept","empirical","adaptation","connectivity","diversity","","no","other","Actinopterygii","Canada","HaidaGwaii","2010.01.01, 1993.01.01","462, 985",730,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","SNP","muscle",NA,"Illumina_BeadArray","Illumina_BeadXPress",NA,"115 sampling sites within Haida Gwaii- too many to list out one by one and did not have a sample size for each","2010.01.01","462"," 985",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Illumina_BeadXpress",8.50547945205479,6209,17.0109589041096

DNA from archived scales of Lake Whitefish collected between 1986 and 1999 were genotyped at 20 microsatellites and 51 gene-coding SNPs associated with growth and reproduction. We found that the Lake Whitefish in Lesser Slave Lake consisted of a single genetic stock, with microsatellites revealing more temporal than spatial variation in allele frequencies. A comparative genome scan among replicate cohorts from commercially harvested versus random survey samples identified one candidate SNP under divergent selection.

However, recent advances in population genomics have enabled scientists to demonstrate population structure in other species that were likewise traditionally assumed to be panmictic. Accordingly, we used DArTseq, a proprietary platform of reduced-representation genome sequencing developed by Diversity Arrays Technology (DArTech) to genotype 222 skipjack tuna from 9 sample groups collected across 6 exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and over 6 years in the tropical Western and Central Pacific Ocean. This is one of the most fine-scale population genetics assessments of skipjack tuna to date. We found several statistically significant pairwise F-ST comparisons using purportedly neutral loci, but very little indication of structure based on observed and expected heterozygosity, effective population size, a Mantel test, AMOVA, numerous genetic clustering and population assignment tests, and exploration of correlation with oceanographic features. Significant pairwise F-ST values were often shallow and resulted in uncertainty about their biological significance. Furthermore, a test of the hypothesis that the geographic and temporal distribution of the potentially adaptive genetic diversity may depict cryptic fine scale structure using two different outlier detection methods, could not reject panmixia based on estimates of fixation indices and two clustering software. Our results support the presence of a single population of skipjack tuna in the tropical Western and Central Pacific Ocean, but highly recommend the expansion of the study area, in latitude, longitude, and seasonality, before drawing any global conclusions.","giuliaa@spc.int",2020,"10.3389/fmars.2020.570760","FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE","temporal-genetics","BR","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","adaptation","connectivity","","marine","Actinopterygii","PapuaNewGuinea","Papua New Guinea","2012.01.01,2011.01.01,2009.01.01,2007.01.01","27,30,31,28",766,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","chronic","SNP","muscle",NA,"CTAB","Illumina_HiSeq","RAD","generation time pulled from: https://www.fishbase.de/summary/katsuwonus-pelamis.html, used DartTech for extraction and sequencing.

Nevertheless, non-native species can also contribute to conservation objectives. In 1673, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a galliform native to southwest Europe, was introduced from France (A. r. rufa) into the UK for hunting purposes. Nowadays, hunters constantly supplement natural populations of A. rufa in its native range with stocks of captive-bred individuals. Such birds are usually genetically unscreened, and human-mediated hybridization with the exotic chukar (Alectoris chukar) has undermined genomic integrity of the species. Alectoris rufa in the UK has never been genetically investigated, and birds from East Anglian estates with no modern history of supplementation offer a potential genomic backup for the highly polluted native-range A. r. rufa. We genotyped modern and ancient (1824-1934) birds at the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) level to determine present and past kinship between East Anglian and native-range A. rufa. We used Short Tandem Repeats (STR) and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to identify A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids. The kinship of East Anglian birds with A. r. rufa was confirmed. No A. chukar introgression was found in ancient East Anglian A. rufa. Among modern partridges, we found birds with A. chukar mtDNA, and both STRs and RAPDs disclosed many A. rufa 9 A. chukar hybrids. While the genetic analysis pointed to the increase of diversity and decline of disparity over time within and among A. rufa populations, respectively, the conservation value of the resource historically introduced to the UK proved to have been quashed by three decades of recent releases of A. chukar and its A. rufa hybrids.","filippo.barbanera@unipi.it",2015,"10.1007/s10530-014-0739-5","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","ancient-dna","JW","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","adaptation","","","terrestrial","Aves","UK,France,Italy,Portugal,Spain","England,England,England,Spain,Spain,France,France.Italy,France,France,France,Spain,France.England,England,England,England,England,England.Spain,Italy,Italy,Italy,Portugal,Italy,England,France.Corsica,Corsica,England.France.Italy,England,France,Spain,Italy.Portugal,Portugal,Italy,Italy,Italy,Portugal,Spain,Spain,Spain,Portugal.Spain.France,Portugal,France,Corsica,Italy,Spain,France,Portugal,England","1824.01.01,1843.01.01,1851.01.01,1856.01.01,1857.01.01,1859.01.01,1872.01.01,1873.01.01,1874.01.01,1876.01.01,1890.01.01,1891.01.01,1892.01.01,1893.01.01,1896.01.01,1897.01.01,1898.01.01,1899.01.01,1903.01.01,1905.01.01,1906.01.01,1907.01.01,1908.01.01,1910.01.01,1912.01.01,1914.01.01,1915.01.01,1916.01.01,1918.01.01,1920.01.01,1921.01.01,1922.01.01,1923.01.01,1924.01.01,1925.01.01,1929.01.01,1930.01.01,1931.01.01,1932.01.01,1934.01.01,1938.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2010.01.01","1,1,1,1,1,1,2.1,1,1,1,1,2.1,1,2,1,1,1.1,1,2,2,1,4,1,1.3,1,1.1.1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,1.2.1,1,2,48,29,48,24,10,58",730,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","invasive_species","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin","dried","QIAamp DNA micro kit","Sanger","PCR","Randi E, Tabarroni C, Rimondi S, Lucchini V, Sfougaris A (2003) Phylogeography of the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca).

The study was based on contemporary and historical samples, the latter represented by DNA extracted from otoliths and scales from the 1950s-1960s. We investigated whether genetic population structure was temporarily stable or unstable, the latter due to relatively small spawning and nursery areas combined with a harsh Arctic environment. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the potential for adaptive responses and local adaptation we estimated effective population size (N-e) and migration rate (m). Temporal stability of genetic population structure was suggested, based on a hierarchical analysis of genetic differentiation showing much higher differentiation among samples from different populations (F-CT = 0.091) than among temporal samples from the same populations (F-SC = 0.01). This was further supported by a neighbor-joining tree and assignment of individuals that showed high contingency between historical and contemporary samples. Estimates of N-e were high (> 500) in three out of four populations, with a lower estimate in one population potentially reflecting fishing pressure or suboptimal environmental conditions. Estimates of m were in most cases low, ae<currency> 0.01. N-e and m estimates suggest a potential for adaptive responses and local adaptation. However, long generation time may also cause adaptive responses by microevolution to be unable to track climate change, especially considering the low migration rates that reduce potential evolutionary rescue by gene flow from populations better adapted to the altered environments.","mmh@bios.au.dk",2018,"10.1007/s10592-018-1047-x","CONSERVATION GENETICS","historical-dna","AAS","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","adaptation","","","other","Actinopterygii","Greenland","Eqaluit,Kapisilit.Kobbefjord River.Qarajat,Kobbefjord River,Praestefjord,Qarajat,Kobbefjord Lake,Kapisilit.Qarajat.Eqaluit,Kobbefjord River.Praestefjord,Lakseelv.Eqaluit","1952.01.01,1953.01.01,1963.01.01,1966.01.01,1969.01.01,2008.01.01,2012.01.01,2013.01.01,2014.01.01","27,36.22.30,7,2,3,22,,20.20.20,20.20,20.20",7300,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","climate_change","","","chronic","nuclear_seq","bone","dried","E.Z.N.A.

It remains unclear why some species persisted whereas others did not. The endemic Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis) has escaped extinction, but colonies on two islands have been extirpated and populations on remaining islands have contracted. We obtained mitochondrial DNA sequences from 100 subfossil bones, 28 museum specimens, and 289 modern samples to investigate patterns of gene flow and temporal changes in the genetic diversity of this endangered species over the last 3,000 years, as Polynesians and then Europeans colonized the Hawaiian Islands. Genetic differentiation was found to be high between both modern and ancient petrel populations. However, gene flow was substantial between the extirpated colonies on Oahu and Molokai and modern birds from the island of Lanai. No significant reductions in genetic diversity occurred over this period, despite fears in the mid-1900s that this species may have been extinct. Simulations show that even a decline to a stable effective population size of 100 individuals would result in the loss of only 5% of the expected heterozygosity. Simulations also show that high levels of genetic diversity may be retained due to the long generation time of this species. Such decoupling between population size and genetic diversity in long-lived species can have important conservation implications. It appears that a pattern of dispersal from declining colonies, in addition to long generation time, may have allowed the Hawaiian petrel to escape a severe genetic bottleneck, and the associated extinction vortex, and persist despite a large population decline after human colonization.","andreann@buffalo.edu",2012,"10.1093/molbev/mss185","MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","ancient-dna","ACS","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","diversity","","","other","Aves","USA","Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Oahu.Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Kauai.Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Kauai.Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Kauai","NA,1907.01.01,1914.01.01,NA","195,12,26,512",5475,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","invasive_species","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","bone","dried","phenol/chloroform Fleischer et al. 2000","Sanger","Targeted_sequence_capture","supplement for generation time.

The Warm Springs pupfish Cyprinodon nevadensis pectoralis","Martin, AP","The Warm Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis pectoralis) inhabits several low flow (<0.15 cfs) springs in an otherwise dry Mojave Desert landscape. Increasing demands on groundwater coupled with predictions of decreased precipitation from global warming make this species a sentinel for biodiversity dependent on springs. Here we examine mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and nuclear microsatellite genotypes for individuals sampled in 1998 and 2007 as a means of inferring the historical demography of the subspecies. Estimates of genetic effective population size from comparison of allele frequencies over time underscores that all spring populations support small populations, typically <100 individuals. Such small population sizes suggest spring populations may have heightened probabilities of extirpation. Despite small population sizes, all springs harbor relatively high levels of genetic variation for both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Unexpectedly high levels of variation may be explained by recent declines in population size coupled with rare episodes of gene flow between springs suspected of occurring during flooding events. The inferences gained from the genetic data provide the basis for evaluating current and future restoration plans. The genetic data suggest there is a need to balance the predicted positive effects of restoring hydrological connectivity with the potential negative impacts of providing avenues for the spread of exotic species detrimental to pupfish populations.","am@colorado.edu",2010,"10.1007/s10592-010-0077-9","CONSERVATION GENETICS","historical-dna","BR","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","popsize","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","California","1998.02.01,2007.04.01","70140",109.25,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","chronic","microsat","fin","ethanol","Qiagen tissue kits",NA,"PCR","Only temporal with microsats.

After that, the number of sika deer in Hokkaido has increased gradually due to the protection by the Hokkaido government. In the present study, in order to investigate the bottleneck effects, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) on sika deer bones excavated from archaeological sites just before Meiji Period. On 86 of 113 bones from 13 archaeological sites of Ainu Culture Period (17-19th centuries), 602 base-pair fragments of the mtDNA control region were successfully sequenced. Consequently, we found three new haplotypes (g-, h- and i-types) which had not been identified in modern sika deer. In addition, four haplotypes (a-, b-, c- and d-types) identified from modern sika deer were also found in the archaeological deer. The new haplotypes and previously reported hapoltypes from sika deer of Hokkaido were phylogenetically much closer to each other, compared with those of modern sika deer from Honshu, Kyushu and the Chinese continent. Geographical distribution patterns of haplotypes of the ancient population were different from those of the modern population in Hokkaido. Our findings indicated that their genetic diversity was reduced through the bottleneck and that population structures of sika deer were changed widely in Hokkaido due to genetic drift.","masudary@ees.hokudai.ac.jp",2004,"10.2108/zsj.21.473","ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE","ancient-dna","EG","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","connectivity","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","Japan,China","Bib.Benten.Onnebetsu.Kushiro-nuasamai.Penakori 1.Osatsu 1.Opaushinai.Setanai-chashi.Usu-oyakotsu.Aoshimanai.Furetoi, Hokkaido.Honshu/Kyushu/China,","","11.11.15.4.8.1.9.9.11.2.1,6.18",1533,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","env_variation","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","bone","dried","Masuda et al., 2001","Sanger","PCR","mentions ancient but I think bones are only 200-300 year old; genartion time from Kalb et al., 2019.",NA,"11.11.15.4.8.1.9.9.11.2.1","6.18",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Japan","China",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous modeling has suggested that global warming will lead to increased abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the ocean around Greenland, but the dynamics of earlier abundance fluctuations are not well understood. We applied a retrospective spatiotemporal population genomics approach to examine the temporal stability of cod population structure in this region and to search for signatures of divergent selection over a 78-year period spanning major demographic changes. Analyzing >900 gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in 847 individuals, we identified four genetically distinct groups that exhibited varying spatial distributions with considerable overlap and mixture. The genetic composition had remained stable over decades at some spawning grounds, whereas complete population replacement was evident at others. Observations of elevated differentiation in certain genomic regions are consistent with adaptive divergence between the groups, indicating that they may respond differently to environmental variation. Significantly increased temporal changes at a subset of loci also suggest that adaptation may be ongoing. These findings illustrate the power of spatiotemporal population genomics for revealing biocomplexity in both space and time and for informing future fisheries management and conservation efforts.","nthe@stanford.edu",2013,"10.1111/eva.12055","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genomics","BR","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","adaptation","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","Greenland,Iceland,Canada","Sisimiut,Danas Banke,Sisimiut,Kapisillit,Uummannaq,Paamiut.Qaqortoq,Store Hellefiskebanke,Ilulissat,Fyllas Banke,Lille Hellefiskebanke,Northeast coastal.Southwest coastal.Southwest offshore,Sisimiut,Danas Banke.Qaqortoq.Paamiut.Ameralik.Qorqut.Kapisillit.Gulf of St Lawrence,Tasiilaq.Offshore East.Offshore South.Offshore West.Sisimiut.Ilulissat.Uummannaq","1932.01.01,1934.01.01,1937.01.01,1943.01.01,1945.01.01,1947.01.01,1950.01.01,1953.01.01,1954.01.01,1957.01.01,2002.01.01,2005.01.01,2008.01.01,2010.01.01","20,31,31,30,30,31.28,31,30,30,31,39.38.39,34,31.27.29.30.30.30.39,29.29.29.39.26.30.25",1825,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","climate_change","","chronic","SNP","bone","dried","Therkildsen et al. 2010","Illumina_BeadXpress","PCR","Generation time from the supplementary","1932.01.01","20","31","31","30","30","31.28","31","30","30","31","39.38.39","34","31.27.29.30.30.30.39","29.29.29.39.26.30.25",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Greenland","Iceland","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15.6109589041096,28490,78.0547945205479

These lineages first came into secondary contact in southeastern Nova Scotia, Canada (NS), where they hybridized, producing latitudinal genetic clines. Previous studies have documented a persistent southward shift in the clines of different marker types, consistent with existing dispersal and recruitment pathways. We evaluated current clinal structure by quantifying the distribution of lineages and fine-scale hybridization patterns across the eastern North American range (25 locations, similar to 39 to 49 degrees N) using informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n=96). In addition, temporal changes in the genetic clines were evaluated using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci (n=9-11) over a 15-year period (2000-2015). Clinal structure was consistent with prior work demonstrating the existence of both northern and southern lineages with a hybrid zone occurring between southern New Brunswick (NB) and southern NS. Extensive later generation hybrids were detected in this region and in southeastern Newfoundland. Temporal genetic analysis confirmed the southward progression of clines over time; however, the rate of this progression was slower than predicted by forecasting models, and current clines for all marker types deviated significantly from these predictions. Our results suggest that neutral and selective processes contribute to cline dynamics, and ultimately, highlight how selection, hybridization, and dispersal can collectively influence invasion success.","sarah.lehnert@dfo-mpo.gc.ca",2018,"10.1111/eva.12657","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","KF","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","adaptation","","","yes","marine","Malacostraca","Canada,USA","lat/lon in table 1","2011.01.01,2013.01.01,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2011.01.01,2011.01.01,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01,2011.01.01,2015.01.01,2015.01.01","22,22,22,64,64,64,64,63,63,84,84,64,86,86,63,22,22,22,32,22,64,62,86,86,60,22,63,32",1096,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","invasive_species","","","chronic","microsat","gills","ethanol","phenol/chloroform, NucleoMag","","PCR","no sequencing platforms listed, lat lon available in table 1, generation time from https://doi.org/10.2307/1548108","2011.01.01","22","22","22","64","64","64","64","63","63","84","84","64","86","86",63,22,"22","22","32",22,64,"62","86","86",60,"22","63","32",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada","USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.33302919708029,1461,4.0027397260274

This goal is particularly worthwhile in an epoch of rampant biotic homogenisation (i.e., the progressive replacement of native biotas with locally expanding non-natives) driven by global change in the context of the ongoing Anthropocene extinction. Under these premises, we provided here a molecular biogeographic framework based on macro-regional scale sampling to support conservation initiatives for the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata). This species, ranging from Pakistan across the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to Sundaland and occurring also in Iraq and extreme southwestern Iran with an isolated population, has experienced a rapid decline over the last decades and is now listed as 'Vulnerable' by the IUCN. We sequenced a 307 bp-long fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome-b (Cyt-b) gene in modem and museum samples (n = 77, of which 23 are new with respect to a previous study) from the entirety of the species range, including holotypes of the three traditionally recognised morphological subspecies (L. p. maxwelli, L. p. sindica, and L. p. perspicillata). We corroborated the occurrence of three patently diverging genetic groups (Middle East, South, and South East Asia) and defined their spatial boundaries. Incidentally, we found that the holotype of L. p. perspicillata from Indonesia (dated 1821) held oriental small-clawed otter (Amyx cinereus) maternal DNA. Although a few evident morphological similarities shared by this specimen with the oriental small-clawed otter cast serious doubts on its current taxonomical identification, it is suggested that the recently disclosed hybridisation in the wild between L. perspicillata and A. cinereus in Singapore might be more geographically extensive and/or have occurred earlier than believed. In conclusion, the molecular biogeographic picture herein is intended to form the basis for supporting management in ex situ facilities (e.g., exchange of individuals among zoos) and for implementing the genetic tracking of illegally traded otters in the attainment of adaptive conservation for L. perspicillata.","filippo.barbanera@unipi.it",2020,"10.26107/RBZ-2020-0084","RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY","historical-dna","KC","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","other","Mammalia","Bangladesh,Cambodia,China,India,Indonesia,Iraq,Laos,Malaysia,Myanmar,Nepal,Pakistan,Thailand,Vietnam","Java, Thailand,Sandakan, Pulau Landgkawi, Chak,Mekong River, Pakse.Paulau Rumbia.Thateng,Bang Nara River, Nilgiri Hills,Chisapani,Kolkata,Abusakhair,Medan,Gongsham,Yingjian,Southeaster,Al-Baghdadiya Lake.Om Am Nyaj Lake,Abu Khasaf,Al-Hawizeh Marsh.Badin.Bangkhuntien.Cambodia.Chatiari Dam.Goth Baquir.Jamrao Headwork.Keti Shah Foest.Khulna Division.Machi Goth.Mohanpur.Nam Nagum.Nara Canal.Near Surat.Peninsular Malaysia.Power House.Vietnam,Near Patna.Tapti River,Al-Edheam.Near Nagpu,Vietnam","1821.01.01,1882.01.01,1887.01.01,1899.01.01,1915.01.01,1924.01.01,1924.01.01,1931.01.01,1948.01.01,1955.01.01,1956.01.01,1970.01.01,1974.01.01,1976.01.01,200,.01.01,2008.01.01,2012.01.01,2014.01.01,2015.01.01,2017.01.01,2017.01.01,2019.01.01","1,1,1,1,1,1,1.1.1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1,1.1,1.1,1",1095,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","env_variation","acute","mtDNA_seq","skin.Bone.Toe pad","","QIAmp DNA Micro Kit","Sanger","PCR","Generation time:https://www.otterspecialistgroup.org/osg-newsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/9.-Lutrogale-perspicillata-Red-List-2020.pdf","1821.01.01","1","1","1","1","1","1","1.1.1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1",1,1,"1.1","1","1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1",1.1,1.1,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bangladesh","Cambodia","China","India","Indonesia","Iraq","Laos","Malaysia","Myanmar","Nepal","Pakistan","Thailand","Vietnam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,66.0438356164384,72318,198.131506849315

In this study, the spatio-temporal patterns of mtDNA polymorphisms were assessed in Indo-Pacific hawksbill turtles from Malaysian nesting rookeries and foraging aggregations sampled during 1996-2014. Clear genetic differences were observed between turtles from the Sabah Turtle Islands rookery in the Sulu Sea, and the rookeries of Melaka and Redang Island in the South China Sea off the Malay Peninsula; however, no temporal genetic changes were found to have occurred on a decadal time scale. Despite the descriptive evaluation of a few samples, Johor nesting turtles possessed different haplotypes from those at the proximate Melaka rookery, indicating the importance of conserving this small nesting population. Although continuous sampling efforts are needed to determine the relationships between specific rookeries and foraging aggregations, the presence of multiple haplotypes in Malaysian foraging aggregations, in combination with Lagrangian drifter buoy data, suggests that there have been migrations to foraging grounds in Southeast Asia from various rookeries.

Despite the importance of this event in the conservation history of New Zealand, and subsequent major advances in rodent eradication and biosecurity, the source and pathway of the rat invasion of Big South Cape Island has never been identified. Using modern molecular methods on contemporary and historical tissue samples, we identify the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype of ship rats (Rattus rattus) on Big South Cape Island and compare it to that of ship rats in the neighbouring regions of Stewart Island/Rakiura and southern New Zealand, all hypothesised as possible source sites for the invasion. We identify two haplotype clusters, each comprising three closely related haplotypes; one cluster unique to Stewart Island, and the other found in southern New Zealand and elsewhere. By a process of elimination we rule that the ship rat invasion of Big South Cape Island was neither by swimming nor boat transport from Stewart Island, and is unlikely to have come from the south coast ports of New Zealand. However, because the ship rat haplotype found on Big South Cape Island is cosmopolitan to New Zealand's South Island and elsewhere, we can only confirm that the invasion likely originated from some distance, but are not able to identify the invasion source more precisely. An unexpected consequence of our study is the discovery of five new mtDNA haplotypes for R. rattus that have not been previously reported.","j.robins@auckland.ac.nz",2016,"10.20417/nzjecol.40.26","NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","historical-dna","BR","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","NewZealand","Big South Cape Island.Stewart Island,Big South Cape Island.South Coast.Bluff.Stewart Island and Surrounding Islands","1960.01.01,2009.06.01","6.11,43.29.8.55",122,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","invasive_species","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","tail.feet","ethanol","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","Sanger","PCR","Generation time: Deinum et al 2016","1960.01.01","6.11","43.29.8.55",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NewZealand",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,147.94262295082,18049,49.4493150684931

One such mechanism, hybridization and subsequent introgression of invasive alleles into native genomes is a serious concern, especially for taxa displaying weak reproductive barriers, as is the case for black basses. Black basses introduced outside of their native ranges thus pose elevated threats to endemic congeners, particularly in the southern United States where restricted ranges preclude refuge from introgression. The recently delineated Bartram's bass (M. sp. cf M. coosae) is endemic to the upper regions of the Savannah River basin, throughout which anthropogenic modification, including impoundment, has been extensive. Non-native Alabama bass (M. henshalli) and smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu) have been introduced into this system on multiple occasions and now threaten Bartram's bass via introgression. In this study we sampled four reservoirs (Jocassee, Keowee, Hartwell, and Russell) in the upper Savannah River during 2004 and 2010. Results from three codominant nuclear loci and one mitochondrial locus revealed extensive introgression between Alabama and Bartram's bass. Results show that Alabama bass have replaced Bartram's bass in lakes Keowee and Russell, where they were first introduced, while the frequencies of hybrids in lakes Jocassee and Hartwell are increasing. Hybridization involving Bartram's bass with native largemouth bass and introduced smallmouth bass was detected in very low frequencies.

Landscape permeability, including partial barriers, influences migratory animals that move across the landscape. Partial barriers are common in rivers where barrier passage varies with streamflow. We explore the influence of partial barriers on the spatial and temporal distribution of migration-linked genotypes of Oncorhynchus mykiss, a salmonid fish with co-occurring resident and migratory forms, in tributaries to the South Fork Eel River, California, USA, Elder and Fox Creeks. We genotyped >4,000 individuals using RAD-capture and classified individuals as resident, heterozygous or migratory genotypes using life history-associated loci. Across four years of study (2014-2017), the permeability of partial barriers varied across dry and wet years. In Elder Creek, the largest waterfall was passable for adults migrating up-river 4-39 days each year. In this stream, the overall spatial pattern, with fewer migratory genotypes above the waterfall, remained true across dry and wet years (67%-76% of migratory alleles were downstream of the waterfall). We also observed a strong relationship between distance upstream and proportion of migratory alleles. In Fox Creek, the primary barrier is at the mouth, and we found that the migratory allele frequency varied with the annual timing of high flow events. In years when rain events occurred during the peak breeding season, migratory allele frequency was high (60%-68%), but otherwise it was low (30% in two years). We highlight that partial barriers and landscape permeability can be temporally dynamic, and this effect can be observed through changing genotype frequencies in migratory animals.","skelson@berkeley.edu",2020,"10.1111/mec.15367","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","BR","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze,Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze,Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze,Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze","2014.01.01,2015.01.01,2016.01.01,2017.01.01","45.731.397.87.186,111.242.155.26.76,89.157.180.23.85,127.151.110.29.74",584,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","acute","SNP","fin","dried","Ali et al., 2016","Illumina_HiSeq","Targeted_sequence_capture","Generation time: Fishbase","2014.01.01","45.731.397.87.186","111.242.155.26.76","89.157.180.23.85","127.151.110.29.74",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.87671232876712,1096,3.0027397260274

Ideally, researchers would conduct genome-scale screening of museum specimens to explore the evolutionary consequences of environmental changes, but to date such analyses have been severely limited by the numerous challenges of working with the highly degraded DNA typical of historic samples. Here, we circumvent these challenges by using custom, multiplexed, exon capture to enrich and sequence similar to 11000 exons (similar to 4Mb) from early 20th-century museum skins. We used this approach to test for changes in genomic diversity accompanying a climate-related range retraction in the alpine chipmunks (Tamias alpinus) in the high Sierra Nevada area of California, USA. We developed robust bioinformatic pipelines that rigorously detect and filter out base misincorporations in DNA derived from skins, most of which likely resulted from postmortem damage. Furthermore, to accommodate genotyping uncertainties associated with low-medium coverage data, we applied a recently developed probabilistic method to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and estimate allele frequencies and the joint site frequency spectrum. Our results show increased genetic subdivision following range retraction, but no change in overall genetic diversity at either nonsynonymous or synonymous sites. This case study showcases the advantages of integrating emerging genomic and statistical tools in museum collection-based population genomic applications. Such technical advances greatly enhance the value of museum collections, even where a pre-existing reference is lacking and points to a broad range of potential applications in evolutionary and conservation biology.","kebi@berkeley.edu",2013,"10.1111/mec.12516","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","ancient-dna","BR","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","Yosemite","1915.01.01,2006.01.01","20,20",365,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","climate_change","env_variation","","chronic","SNP","skin","dried","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","Illumina_HiSeq","Targeted_sequence_capture","Generation time: Ingles 1965","1915.01.01","20","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,91.0630136986301,33238,91.0630136986301
"36",40,141,NA,"Genetic evidence for the persistence of the critically endangered Sierra Nevada red fox in California","Perrine, JD; Pollinger, JP; Sacks, BN; Barrett, RH; Wayne, RK","California is home to both the native state-threatened Sierra Nevada red fox (Vulpes vulpes necator), which historically inhabited high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains, and to multiple low-elevation red fox populations thought to be of exotic origin. During the past few decades the lowland populations have dramatically expanded their distribution, and possibly moved into the historic range of the native high-elevation fox. To determine whether the native red fox persists in its historic range in California, we compared mitochondrial cytochrome-b haplotypes of the only currently-known high-elevation population (n = 9 individuals) to samples from 3 modern lowland populations (n = 35) and historic (1911-1941) high-elevation (n = 22) and lowland (n = 7) populations. We found no significant population differentiation among the modern and historic high-elevation populations (average pairwise F-ST = 0.06), but these populations differed substantially from all modern and historic lowland populations (average pairwise F-ST = 0.52). Among lowland populations, the historic and modern Sacramento Valley populations were not significantly differentiated from one another (F-ST = -0.06), but differed significantly from recently founded populations in the San Francisco Bay region and in southern California (average pairwise F-ST = 0.42). Analysis of molecular variance indicated that 3 population groupings (mountain, Sacramento Valley, and other lowland regions) explained 45% of molecular variance (F-CT = 0.45) whereas only 4.5% of the variance was partitioned among populations within these groupings (F-SC = 0.08). These findings provide strong evidence that the native Sierra Nevada red fox has persisted in northern California. However, all nine samples from this population had the same haplotype, suggesting that several historic haplotypes may have become lost. Unidentified barriers have apparently prevented gene flow from the Sacramento Valley population to other eastern or southern populations in California. Future studies involving nuclear markers are needed to assess the origin of the Sierra Nevada red fox and to quantify levels of nuclear gene flow.","perrine@nature.berkeley.edu",2007,"10.1007/s10592-006-9265-z","CONSERVATION GENETICS","ancient-dna","JW","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","Siskiyou,Tulare,Mariposa,Mono,Mono,Colusa.Mono,Lassen,Colusa,Mono,Glen.Mono,Siskiyou,Colusa,Nevada,Tehama,Butte,Colusa.Napa,Glen,Butte.Tehama,Glenn,Marin,Tehama,Los Angeles,Los Angeles,Los Angeles.Santa Barbara,Santa Barbara,Santa Barbara,Alameda.Butte.Santa Barbara,Alameda.San Mateo.Santa Barbara,Fesno.San Joaquin.San Mateo,Shasta.Tehama,Kern.Shasta.Tehama,Colusa.Kings.Shasta.Tehama,Butte.Shasta,Los Angeles.Santa Barbara.Yolo,Kern,Glen","1904.01,1911.01.01,1916.01.01,1921.01.01,1922.01.01,1923.01.01,1925.01.01,1926.01.01,1928.01.01,1929.01.01,1934.01.01,1935.01.01,1941.01.01,1948.01.01,1966.01.01,1968.01.01,1969.01.01,1970.01.01,1973.01.01,1982.01.01,1986.01.01,1988.01.01,1989.01.01,1990.01.01,1993.01.01,1994.01.01,1995.01.01,1996.01.01,1997.01.01,1998.01.01,1999.01.01,2000.01.01,2001.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01","1,3,1,1,3,1.5,2,7,2,1.2,2,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1.1,1,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1,1.1.1,3.3.1,1.1.1,1.3,1.2.2,1.1.1.2,1.3,1.1,1,1",365,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin.bones.feces.ear punch","dried","QIAamp minikit (Qiagen)","Sanger","PCR","Generation time: Lariviere & Pasitschniak-Arts 1996","1904.01","1","3","1","1","3","1.5","2","7","2","1.2","2","1","1","1",1,1.1,"1","1.1","1",1,1,"1","1","1.1",1,"1","1.1.1","3.3.1","1.1.1",1.3,"1.2.2","1.1.1.2",1.3,1.1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Particularly nongregarious mammalian species present an underexplored field of study: despite their lower levels of sociality compared to group-living species, interactions among individuals do occur, providing opportunities for cryptic kin selection. Among the least gregarious primates are orang-utans (genus: Pongo), in which preferential associations among females have nevertheless been observed, but for which the presence of kin structures was so far unresolved because of the equivocal results of previous genetic studies. To clarify relatedness and dispersal patterns in orang-utans, we examined the largest longitudinal set of individuals with combined genetic, spatial and behavioural data. We found that males had significantly higher mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and more unique haplotypes, thus underscoring their different maternal ancestries compared to females. Moreover, pedigree reconstruction based on 24 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and mtDNA haplotypes demonstrated the presence of three matrilineal clusters of generally highly related females with substantially overlapping ranges. In orang-utans and possibly other nongregarious species, comparing average biparental relatedness (r) of males and females to infer sex-biased dispersal is extremely problematic. This is because the opportunistic sampling regime frequently employed in nongregarious species, combined with overlapping space use of distinct matrilineal clusters, leads to a strong downward bias when mtDNA lineage membership is ignored. Thus, in nongregarious species, correct inferences of dispersal can only be achieved by combining several genetic approaches with detailed spatial information.","n.arora@aim.uzh.ch",2012,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05608.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","museum-dna","JW","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","Indonesia","Tuanan Orangutan Research Area (Lat/long in SI-rangingdata.csv)","2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2005.01.01,2006.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2009.01.01","2893, 6139, 7030, 6214, 6625, 7775, 6103",9125,"pre-designed","natural","habitat_loss","","","acute","mtDNA_seq","feces",NA,"QUAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen)","","PCR","Generation time: Wich et al. 2009","2003.01.01","2893"," 6139"," 7030"," 6214"," 6625"," 7775"," 6103",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Indonesia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.240219178082192,2192,6.00547945205479

We compared historic (1894-1906) to modern (1988-2006) genetic variation in 11 populations of warbler finches at 14 microsatellite loci. Although several lines of evidence suggest that Darwin's finches may be in decline, we found that the genetic diversity of warbler finches has not generally declined, and broad-scale patterns of variation remained similar over time. Contrary to expectations, inferred population sizes have generally increased over time (6-8%) as have immigration rates (8-16%), which may reflect a recent increase in the frequency and intensity of El Nino events. Individual island populations showed significant declines (18-19%) and also substantial gains (18-20%) in allelic richness over time. Changes in genetic diversity were correlated with changes in immigration rates, but did not correspond to population size or human disturbance. These results reflect the expected stabilizing properties of whole metapopulations over time.

The influence of spatial structure on population dynamics within river-stream networks is poorly understood. Utilizing spatially explicit analyses of temporal genetic variance, we tested whether persistence of central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) reflects differences in habitat quality and location within a highly modified urban catchment in southwestern Ohio, U.S.A. 2. Estimates of genetic diversity did not vary with habitat quality. Nevertheless, evidence of weak but temporally stable genetic structure, location-dependent effective population sizes and rates of immigration among sites, together suggest that persistence of central stonerollers within the catchment may be attributable to source-sink dynamics driven by habitat heterogeneity. 3. Under this scenario, migrant-pool colonization from areas of relatively high habitat quality in the upper catchment sustains the presence of central stonerollers at degraded sites in the main stem and dampens population subdivision within the catchment. However, because intact habitat is restricted to the upper portion of the catchment, it is not possible to preclude net downstream dispersal as a mechanism contributing to source-sink dynamics. The slight genetic structure that persists appears to reflect weak isolation by distance diminished by high rates of immigration. 4. This study suggests that without a systems perspective of the conditions that sustain populations in degraded waterways, environmental assessments may underestimate levels of impairment. Conservation and management of stream fishes could be improved by maintaining habitat in areas that are net exporters of migrants or by remediation of impaired habitat.","waits.eric@epa.gov",2008,"10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02030.x","FRESHWATER BIOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KF","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","Lat/lon available in table 1","1995.001.01,2001.01.01","22.13.28.22.23,80.10.57.45.48.24.287.103",547.5,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat","fin","frozen","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","Sanger","PCR","Generation time: Smith 1979","1995.001.01","22.13.28.22.23","80.10.57.45.48.24.287.103",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To test these predictions, we analyse population genetic diversity and divergence patterns of the Eurasian round goby Neogobius melanostomus across the two decades of its North American invasion in the Laurentian Great Lakes, comparing results from 13 nuclear DNA microsatellite lociand mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b sequences. We test whether genetic stasis', genetic replacement' and/or genetic supplement' scenarios have occurred at the invasion's core and expansion sites, in comparison with its primary native source population in the Dnieper River, Black Sea. Results reveal pronounced genetic divergence across the exotic range, with population areas remaining genetically distinct and statistically consistent across two decades, supporting genetic stasis' and founder takes most'. The original genotypes continue to predominate, whose high population growth likely outpaced the relative success of later arrivals. The original invasion core has stayed the most similar to the native source. Secondary expansion sites indicate slight allelic composition convergence towards the core population over time, attributable to some early genetic supplementation'. The geographic and temporal coverage of this investigation offers a rare opportunity to discern population dynamics over time and space in context of invasion genetic theory vs. reality.","carol.stepien@noaa.gov",2017,"10.1111/mec.13997","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","RC","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA,Ukraine","Saint Clair River,Lake Saint Clair.Lake Errie Islands.Central Lake Erie,Lake Michigan,Lake Erie Islands.Central Lake Erie.Dnieper River Black Sea,Lake Erie Islands,Lake Michigan.Saint Clair River.Lake Saint Clair.Lake Erie Islands.Central Lake Erie.Dnieper River Black Sea,Lake Michigan.Saint Clair River.Lake Erie Islands.Central Lake Erie,Lake Michigan.Saint Clair River.Lake Saint Clair.Lake Erie Islands.Central Lake Erie.Dnieper River Black Sea ","1993.01.01,1998.01.01,1999.01.01,2002.01.01,2005.01.01,2007.01.01,2011.01.01,2013.01.01","45,39.51.24,19,50.29.25,49,50.50.50.40.50.25,44.34.32.45.48,50.50.50.50.50.53",730,"pre-designed","natural","invasive_species","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","fin","ethanol","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","Sanger","PCR","Generation time: MacInnis & Corkum 2000; invasive species","1993.01.01","45","39.51.24","19","50.29.25","49","50.50.50.40.50.25","44.34.32.45.48","50.50.50.50.50.53",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA","Ukraine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.0068493150685,7305,20.013698630137

However, so far, the number of practical cases of marine fisheries management using genetics has been limited. Here, we used Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea to demonstrate the applicability of genetics to a complex management scenario involving mixing of two genetically divergent populations. Specifically, we addressed several assumptions used in the current assessment of the two populations. Through analysis of 483 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the Atlantic cod genome, we confirmed that a model of mechanical mixing, rather than hybridization and introgression, best explained the pattern of genetic differentiation. Thus, the fishery is best monitored as a mixed-stock fishery. Next, we developed a targeted panel of 39 SNPs with high statistical power for identifying population of origin and analyzed more than 2,000 tissue samples collected between 2011 and 2015 as well as 260 otoliths collected in 2003/2004. These data provided high spatial resolution and allowed us to investigate geographical trends in mixing, to compare patterns for different life stages and to investigate temporal trends in mixing. We found similar geographical trends for the two time points represented by tissue and otolith samples and that a recently implemented geographical management separation of the two populations provided a relatively close match to their distributions. In contrast to the current assumption, we found that patterns of mixing differed between juveniles and adults, a signal likely linked to the different reproductive dynamics of the two populations. Collectively, our data confirm that genetics is an operational tool for complex fisheries management applications. We recommend focussing on developing population assessment models and fisheries management frameworks to capitalize fully on the additional information offered by genetically assisted fisheries monitoring.","jhh@aqua.dtu.dk",2019,"10.1111/eva.12760","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","JW","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","Denmark,Germany,Sweden,Poland","Western,Eastern,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Eastern,Western,Mixing Zone,Eastern, Western,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone,Mixing Zone","1996.02.01,1997.04.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2007.02.01,2007.03.01,2011.06.01,2012.01.01,2012.02.01,2013.07.01,2013.11.01,2014.02.01,2014.04.01,2014.08.01,2014.10.01,2015.02.01,2015.07.01,2015.09.01","40,40,128,132,40,37,536,150,150,41,150,150,21,289,145,229,236,90,155",1825,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","acute","SNP","bone","dried","Bonanomi et al. 2015","Fluidigm BioMark HD","SNP_array","Generation time: Therkildsen et al., 2013 supplementary","1996.02.01","40","40","128","132","40","37","536","150","150","41","150","150","21","289",145,229,"236","90","155",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Denmark","Germany","Sweden","Poland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3.91890410958904,7152,19.5945205479452

The highly dispersive male sex may be the prime driver to connect otherwise isolated populations. We therefore studied the temporal and spatial structure of the male population of Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus 1758) and Bombus lapidarius (Linnaeus 1758) using microsatellite DNA markers. We found that the majority of the males in a 1000 mA(2) sampling area originated from colonies located outside of the workers foraging range, which was consistent with the genetic distances among colonies. The analyses of temporal population sub-structure based on both colony detection rate over time and the clustering software STRUCTURE consistently suggested one large and temporally unstructured male population. Our results indicate an extended male flight distance for both species. Though the range of queen dispersal remains to be studied, the effective size (N (e)) of bumblebees is increased by extended male mating flight ranges (A (m) ) exceeding worker foraging distance by factor 1.66 (A (m) = 69.75 km(2)) and 1.74 (A (m) = 13.41 km(2)), B. terrestris and B. lapidarius, respectively. Thus this behaviour may counteract genetic deprivation and its effects. All populations were genetically highly diverse and showed no signs of inbreeding. We discuss the implications of our findings in context of bumblebee population dynamics and conservation. We also highlight the effects and benefits of sampling both workers and males for population genetic studies.","stephan.wolf@rothamsted.ac.uk",2012,"10.1007/s10144-011-0285-2","POPULATION ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KC","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","","","no","terrestrial","Insecta","Germany","Lat/lon in methods","2008.06.24, 2008.06.25, 2008.06.26, 2008.06.27, 2008.06.28, 2008.06.29, 2008.06.30, 2008.07.01, 2008.07.02, 2008.07.03, 2008.07.04, 2008.07.05, 2008.07.06, 2008.07.07, 2008.07.08, 2008.07.09, 2008.07.10, 2008.07.11, 2008.07.12, 2008.07.13, 2008.07.14, 2008.07.15, 2008.07.16, 2008.07.17, 2008.07.18, 2008.07.19, 2008.07.20, 2008.07.21, 2008.07.22, 2008.07.23, 2008.07.24 2008.07.25","352",182.5,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","acute","microsat","leg","ethanol","Chelex","Sanger","PCR","Generation time: Rasmont et al., 2013","2008.06.24","352",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.164383561643836,30,0.0821917808219178

A case study of coastal Atlantic cod","Knutsen, H; Olsen, EM; Jorde, PE; Espeland, SH; Andre, C; Stenseth, NC","A key question in many genetic studies on marine organisms is how to interpret a low but statistically significant level of genetic differentiation. Do such observations reflect a real phenomenon, or are they caused by confounding factors such as unrepresentative sampling or selective forces acting on the marker loci? Further, are low levels of differentiation biologically trivial, or can they represent a meaningful and perhaps important finding? We explored these issues in an empirical study on coastal Atlantic cod, combining temporally replicated genetic samples over a 10-year period with an extensive capture-mark-recapture study of individual mobility and population size. The genetic analyses revealed a pattern of differentiation between the inner part of the fjord and the open skerries area at the fjord entrance. Overall, genetic differentiation was weak (average F-ST = 0.0037), but nevertheless highly statistical significant and did not depend on particular loci that could be subject to selection. This spatial component dominated over temporal change, and temporal replicates clustered together throughout the 10-year period. Consistent with genetic results, the majority of the recaptured fish were found close to the point of release, with < 1% of recaptured individuals dispersing between the inner fjord and outer skerries. We conclude that low levels of genetic differentiation in this marine fish can indeed be biologically meaningful, corresponding to separate, temporally persistent, local populations. We estimated the genetically effective sizes (N-e) of the two coastal cod populations to 198 and 542 and found a N-e/N (spawner) ratio of 0.14.","halvor.knutsen@imr.no",2011,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04979.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KC","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","","","no","marine","Actinopterygii","Norway","Flord, Fjord, Fjord.Skerries, Skerries,Skerries.North Sea,North Sea, Fjord.Skerries, Fjord.Skerries","1996.01.01,1997.01.01,1998.01.01,2000.01.01,2001.01.01,2002.01.01,2004.01.01,2005.01.01","100,100,100.100,101,100.101,100,99.98,188.100",1825,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat","body","frozen","Viogene Inc. mini prep","Sanger","PCR","Generation time: Therkildsen et al., 2013 supplementary","1996.01.01","100","100","100.100","101","100.101","100","99.98","188.100",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Norway",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.80164383561644,3288,9.00821917808219

Genetic rescue by gene flow from a more diverse or differentiated source population of the same species can be an effective strategy for alleviating inbreeding depression and boosting evolutionary potential. The helmeted honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops cassidix is a critically endangered subspecies of the common yellow-tufted honeyeater. Cassidix has declined to a single wild population of similar to 130 birds, despite being subject to intensive population management over recent decades. We assessed changes in microsatellite diversity in cassidix over the last four decades and used population viability analysis to explore whether genetic rescue through hybridization with the neighbouring Lichenostomus melanops gippslandicus subspecies constitutes a viable conservation strategy. The contemporary cassidix population is characterized by low genetic diversity and effective population size (N-e<50), suggesting it is vulnerable to inbreeding depression and will have limited capacity to evolve to changing environments. We find that gene flow from gippslandicus to cassidix has declined substantially relative to pre-1990 levels and argue that natural levels of gene flow between the two subspecies should be restored. Allowing gene flow (similar to 4 migrants per generation) from gippslandicus into cassidix (i.e. genetic rescue), in combination with continued annual release of captive-bred cassidix (i.e. demographic rescue), should lead to positive demographic and genetic outcomes. Although we consider the risk of outbreeding depression to be low, we recommend that genetic rescue be managed within the context of the captive breeding programme, with monitoring of outcomes.","katherine.harrisson@gmail.com",2016,"10.1111/mec.13547","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","museum-dna","KF","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","","","yes","terrestrial","Aves","Australia",NA,"1990.01.01,1991.01.01,1998.01.01,2006.06.01,2011.06.01","25,47,22,17,36",1095,"opportunistic","natural","habitat_loss","","","acute","microsat","blood.tissue","ethanol, frozen","Qiagen.Harrisson et al. 2012","Li-Cor 4200.4300 Global IR2","PCR","Generation time: Smales et al. 2009","1990.01.01","25","47","22","17","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7.14246575342466,7821,21.427397260274

Declared extirpated in the wild in 1980, red wolves were reintroduced to northeastern North Carolina nearly a decade later. Interbreeding with coyotes was thought to be restricted to a narrow geographic region adjacent to the reintroduced population and largely believed to threaten red wolf recovery. However, red wolf ancestry was recently discovered in canids along the American Gulf Coast, igniting a broader survey of ancestry in southeastern canid populations. Here, we examine geographic and temporal patterns of genome-wide red wolf ancestry in 260 canids across the southeastern United States at over 164 000 SNP loci. We found that red wolf ancestry was most prevalent in canids sampled from Texas in the mid-1970s, although non-trivial amounts of red wolf ancestry persist in this region today. Further, red wolf ancestry was also observed in a subset of coyotes inhabiting North Carolina, despite management efforts to limit the occurrence of hybridization events. Lastly, we found no evidence of substantial red wolf ancestry in southeastern canids outside of these 2 admixture zones. Overall, this study provides a genome-wide survey of red wolf ancestry in canids across the southeastern United States, which may ultimately inform future red wolf restoration efforts.","elizabeth.heppenheimer@gmail.com; vonholdt@princeton.edu",2020,"10.1093/jhered/esaa006","JOURNAL OF HEREDITY","temporal-genomics","KF","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","","","yes","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA,Switzerland","Texas,Texas,North Carolina, North Carolina.Zurich, North Carolina.Tennessee,North Carolina,North Carolina, North Carolina.Tennessee,North Carolina,North Carolina,North Carolina,North Carolina,North Carolina,Arizona.North Carolina,New Mexico.North Carolina,North Carolina,Idaho.Nebraska.North Carolina.Oklahoma,Noew Mexico.North Carolina,Arizona.North Carolina,North Carolina,North Carolina.Oklahoma,Alabama.Captive.Georgia.Louisiana.South Carolina.Virginia.Wyoming,Idaho.Missouri.Texas.Virginia,Alabama.Florida.Idaho.Kentucky.Missouri","1975.01.01,1976.01.01,1991.01.01,1997.01.01,1998.01.01,1999.01.01,2000.01.01,2001.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2005.01.01,2006.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2009.01.01,2010.01.01,2011.01.01,2012.01.01,2013.01.01,2014.01.01,2015.01.01,2016.01.01,2017.01.01","4,6,7,1.35,2.1,1,2,2.1,1,1,2,2,2,1.2,2.2,5,2.3.7.2,1.3,1.1,9,1.1,19.17.31.3.18.41.3,1.2.2.11,1.5.2.32.1",1788.5,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","disease","chronic","SNP","blood.tissue","","BioSpring 96 DNA Blood Kit","Illumina_HiSeq","RAD","Generation time: Faust et al 2016 (Feasibility Study);Dates that were pre/post or unkown not included.","1975.01.01","4","6","7","1.35","2.1","1","2","2.1","1","1","2","2","2","1.2",2.2,5,"2.3.7.2","1.3","1.1",9,1.1,"19.17.31.3.18.41.3","1.2.2.11","1.5.2.32.1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA","Switzerland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8.5775789767962,15341,42.0301369863014

However, another population of unknown origin has occurred in arid habitats in the Sacramento Valley of California well outside this narrow bioclimatic niche since at least 1880. If native, this population would be ecologically distinct among indigenous North American red foxes. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite markers from historical and modern samples (modes: 1910-1930 and 2000-2008, respectively) obtained throughout the western United States to determine the origins of the Sacramento Valley red fox, and assess the historical and modern connectivity and genetic effective population sizes of Sacramento Valley and montane red foxes. We found clear and consistent evidence supporting the indigenous origin of the Sacramento Valley population, including the phylogenetic positioning of the dominant, endemic mtDNA clade and microsatellite clustering of the Sacramento Valley population with the nearest montane population. Based on both mitochondrial and microsatellite AMOVAs, connectivity among Western populations of red foxes declined substantially between historical and modern time periods. Estimates based on temporal losses in gene diversity for both marker types suggest that both the Sierra Nevada (including the Southern Cascades population) and the Sacramento Valley populations have small genetic effective population sizes. Significant heterozygote excesses also indicate the occurrence of recent bottlenecks in these populations. Both substitutions distinguishing the 2 endemic Sacramento Valley haplotypes from the dominant montane haplotype were in the coding region and nonsynonymous, consistent with adaptive differences. These findings along with previously reported body size distinctions between Sacramento Valley and montane red foxes argue for distinct subspecific status for the Sacramento Valley red fox, for which we propose the designation V. v. patwin n. subsp. The small genetic effective population size estimates for the Sierra Nevada red fox and Sacramento Valley red fox are cause for concern, as is the possibility of genetic introgression into the latter population from an adjacent, recently established nonnative population.","bnsacks@ucdavis.edu",2010,"10.1007/s10592-010-0053-4","CONSERVATION GENETICS","historical-dna","KF","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","Sierra Nevada,Rockies.South Cascades.Sierra Nevada,North Cascades,Sierra Nevada,North Cascades.South Cascades,South Cascades,North Cascades,Rockies,Rockies,Sacramento Valley,Rockies,Rockies,Sierra Nevada,Rockies,Rockies.Sierra Nevada,Rockies,North Cascades.Sierra Nevada,North Cascades.Rockies.Sierra Nevada,Rockies.Sacramento Valley.Sierra Nevada,Rockies.South Cascades,South Cascades,Sacramento Valley,Sierra Nevada,Sacramento Valley.Sierra Nevada,South Cascades,North Cascades.South Cascades,South Cascades.Sierra Nevada,Sacramento Valley,Rockies,Rockies.South Cascades,Sierra Nevada,Sacramento Valley,Rockies,Sacramento Valley,Sacramento Valley,Sacramento Valley,Sacramento Valley,Sacramento Valley,North Cascades,North Cascades,North Cascades,North Cascades,North Cascades,North Cascades,North Cascades,Sacramento Valley,Sacramento Valley,San Joaquin Valley,South Cascades.San Joaquin Valley.Sacramento Valley,South Cascades.San Joaquin Valley,South Cascades.San Joaquin Valley,South Cascades.San Joaquin Valley.Sacramento Valley,Rockies.South Cascades.San Joaquin Valley.Sacramento Valley,Rockies.San Joaquin Valley,San Joaquin Valley,Rockies.San Joaquin Valley.Sacramento Valley,Rockies,South Cascades.Sacramento Valley,Rockies.South Cascades.Sacramento Valley","1891.01.01,1893.01.01,1895.01.01,1896.01.01,1897.01.01,1900.01.01,1901.01.01,1903.01.01,1909.01.01,1910.01.01,1911.01.01,1915.01.01,1916.01.01,1917.01.01,1921.01.01,1922.01.01,1923.01.01,1924.01.01,1925.01.01,1926.01.01,1928.01.01,1929.01.01,1931.01.01,1932.01.01,1934.01.01,1935.01.01,1938.01.01,1939.01.01,1941.01.01,1948.01.01,1952.01.01,1966.01.01,1967.01.01,1968.01.01,1970.01.01,1973.01.01,1974.01.01,1979.01.01,1980.01.01,1981.01.01,1982.01.01,1983.01.01,1984.01.01,1986.01.01,1989.01.01,1997.01.01,1998.01.01,1999.01.01,2000.01.01,2001.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2005.01.01,2006.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01","2,5.3.1,2,1,2.2,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,2,5,6.1,2,1.1,1.1.3,3.1.5,1.1,2,6,2,1.2,1,1.1,2.2,1,3,1.1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,2,5.1.4,4.1,4.1,2.1.3,15.1.7.1,6.4,9,2.7.1,15,1.1,2.1.2,8.14",365,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","habitat_loss","","chronic","microsat","tissue.feces.bones","","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen).QiaAmp Stool Kit.phenol.chloroform","Sanger","PCR","Generation time: This paper; other species not included becuase use only as outgroup","1891.01.01","2","5.3.1","2","1","2.2","1","1","1","3","1","1","1","2","5",6.1,2,"1.1","1.1.3","3.1.5",1.1,2,"6","2","1.2",1,"1.1","2.2","1","3",1.1,"1","1",1,1,1,2,1,1,"1",1,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,2,"5.1.4",4.1,4.1,"2.1.3","15.1.7.1",6.4,9,"2.7.1",15,1.1,"2.1.2",8.14,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,117.076712328767,42733,117.076712328767

Although landscape change is widely recognized as a strong driver of microevolutionary processes, few landscape genetic studies have directly evaluated the change in spatial genetic structure (SGS) over time with concurrent changes in landscape pattern. We introduce a novel approach to analyze landscape genetic data through time. We demonstrate this approach using genotyped samples (n=569) from a large black bear (Ursus americanus) population in Michigan (USA) that were harvested during 3years (2002, 2006, and 2010). We identified areas that were consistently occupied over this 9-year period and quantified temporal variation in SGS. Then, we evaluated alternative hypotheses about effects of changes in landscape features (e.g., deforestation or crop conversion) on fine-scale SGS among years using spatial autoregressive modeling and model selection. Relative measures of landscape change such as magnitude of landscape change (i.e., number of patches changing from suitable to unsuitable states or vice versa), and during later periods, measures of fragmentation (i.e., patch aggregation and cohesion) were associated with change in SGS. Our results stress the importance of conducting time series studies for the conservation and management of wildlife inhabiting rapidly changing landscapes.","hdraheim@gmail.com",2018,"10.1111/eva.12617","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","ACS","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","","2002.01.01,2006.01.01,2010.01.01","263,385,336",2299.5,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","","","acute","microsat","teeth",NA,"DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","Sanger","PCR","Generation Time: Onorato et al. 2004","2002.01.01","263","385","336",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.27071102413568,2922,8.00547945205479

Despite past analysis with DNA sequencing, microsatellite and isozyme methods, management decisions remain hampered by contradictory findings. For example, it remains unresolved whether Japanese eels are a single panmictic population or whether they harbor significant substructure. Accurate assessment of population genetic substructure, both spatial and temporal, is essential for determining the relevant number of distinct management units appropriate for this species. In the present study, we assayed genetic variation genome-wide using Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) technology to analyze the population genetic structure of Japanese eels. For analysis of temporal isolation, five cohort samples were collected yearly from 2005 to 2009 in the Yangtze River Estuary. For analysis of spatial structure, five arrival wave samples were collected in China in 2009, and two arrival wave samples were collected in Japan in 2001. In each cohort of each arrival wave, five individuals were collected for a total of 55 eels sampled. In total, 214,210 loci were identified from these individuals, 106,652 of which satisfied quality checks and were retained for further analysis. There was relatively little population differentiation between arrival waves and cohorts collected either at different locations during the same year (F-st=0.077) or at the same location collected over subsequent years (F-st=0.082), and locations displayed no consistent isolation-by-distance.","ac347@cornell.edu",2019,"10.1007/s10592-019-01146-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","ACS","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","other","Actinopterygii","Japan,China","Chibaken.Kagawa,Yangtze River Estuary,Yangtze River Estuary,Guangdong province.Fujian,Zhejiang.Jiangsu,Guangdong province.Yangtze River Estuary,Yangtze River Estuary","2001.01.01,2005.02.01,2006.03.01,2009.01.01,2009.02.01,2009.03.01,2012.01.01,20014.01.01","5.5,5,5,5.5,5.5,5.5",3102.5,"pre-designed","","","","","","SNP","fin","ethanol","phenol-chloroform","Illumina_HiSeq","RAD","No driver process; Generation Time (Age at maturity): Kotake et al. 2007","2001.01.01","5.5","5","5","5.5","5.5","5.5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Japan","China",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.29476228847703,4017,11.0054794520548

Next-generation sequencing allows for thousands of genomic markers to be analyzed, which provides the resolution needed to address these questions in marine species with weakly differentiated populations. Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is one of the most important exploited demersal species throughout the North Atlantic, in particular in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. There, two nurseries are known, the St. Lawrence Estuary and the northern Anticosti Island, but their contribution to the renewal of stocks remains unknown. The goals of this study were (a) to document the genetic structure and (b) to estimate the contribution of the different identified breeding stocks to nurseries. We sampled 100 juveniles per nursery and 50 adults from seven sites ranging from Saguenay Fjord to offshore Newfoundland, with some sites sampled over two consecutive years in order to evaluate the temporal stability of the contribution. Our results show that after removing sex-linked markers, the Estuary/Gulf of St. Lawrence represents a single stock which is genetically distinct from the Atlantic around Newfoundland (F-ST = 0.00146, p-value = .001). Population assignment showed that recruitment in both nurseries is predominantly associated with the St. Lawrence stock. However, we found that the relative contribution of both stocks to the nurseries is temporally variable with 1% contribution of the Newfoundland stock one year but up to 33% for the second year, which may be caused by year-to-year variation in larval transport into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This study serves as a model for the identification of stocks for fisheries resources in a context where few barriers to dispersal occur, in addition to demonstrating the importance of considering sex-linked markers and temporal replicates in studies of population genomics.","emilie.carrier.10@ulaval.ca",2020,"10.1111/eva.12979","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genomics","BR","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","Canada","ESTJ.ANTJ.SAGU.ESTU.GASP.NANT.ESQU.NFLD.NFLG,ESTJ.ANTJ.SAGU.ESTU.GASP.NANT.ESQU.NFLD.NFLG,","2016.01.01,2017.01.01","100.100.50.50.50.50.50.50.50,100.100.50.50.50.50.50.50.50",4034.5,"pre-designed","","","","","","SNP","fin","ethanol","Aljanabi & Martinez 1997","Ion_Torrent","RAD","No driver process; Generation time (Age at 50% maturity): Morgan and Bowering 2000","2016.01.01","100.100.50.50.50.50.50.50.50","100.100.50.50.50.50.50.50.50",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.0907175610360639,366,1.0027397260274

While it is known that both dispersal and spatially autocorrelated environmental variation (i.e., the Moran effect) can synchronize populations, the relative contributions of each, and how they interact, are generally unknown. Distinguishing these mechanisms and their effects on synchrony can help us to better understand spatial population dynamics, design conservation and management strategies, and predict climate change impacts. Population genetic data can be used to tease apart these two processes as the spatio-temporal genetic patterns they create are expected to be different. A challenge, however, is that genetic data are often collected at a single point in time, which may introduce context-specific bias. Spatio-temporal sampling strategies can be used to reduce bias and to improve our characterization of the drivers of spatial synchrony. Using spatio-temporal analyses of genotypic data, our objective was to identify the relative support for these two mechanisms to the spatial synchrony in population dynamics of the irruptive forest insect pest, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), in Quebec (Canada). AMOVA, cluster analysis, isolation by distance, and sPCA were used to characterize spatio-temporal genomic variation using 1,370 SBW larvae sampled over four years (2012-2015) and genotyped at 3,562 SNP loci. We found evidence of overall weak spatial genetic structure that decreased from 2012 to 2015 and a genetic diversity homogenization among the sites. We also found genetic evidence of a long-distance dispersal event over >140 km. These results indicate that dispersal is the key mechanism involved in driving population synchrony of the outbreak. Early intervention management strategies that aim to control source populations have the potential to be effective through limiting dispersal. However, the timing of such interventions relative to outbreak progression is likely to influence their probability of success.","larroque.jeremy@gmail.com",2019,"10.1111/eva.12852","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","EG","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","Canada","site1.site2.site3.site4.site5.site6.site7.site8.site9.site10.site11.site12.site13.site14.site15.site16.site17.site18.site19.site20.site21.site22.site23.site24.site25.site26.site27.site28.site29.site30,site10.site11.site13.site16.site17.site18.site23.site27.site28.site29.site31.site32.site35.site36,site10.site11.site12.site13.site16.site18.site23.site24.site26.site27.site29.site31.site33.site35.site36.site37.site38,site11.site14.site18.site24.site29.site31.site33.site34.site35.site36","2012.06.01,2013.06.01,2014.06.01,2015.06.01","25.24.16.21.21.8.17.12.24.22.23.19.25.25.10.24.24.24.10.15.25.25.7.9.9,25.24.28.31.27.31.18.29.28.33.32.16.32.32,9.16.15.12.15.17.11.14.12.12.12.10.14.14.15.15.10,19.14.19.19.15.15.13.14.12",365,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","invasive_species","","chronic","SNP","body","frozen","Qiagen DNA Blood and Tissue Kit","Illumina_HiSeq","RAD","Generation time: Royama 1984","2012.06.01","25.24.16.21.21.8.17.12.24.22.23.19.25.25.10.24.24.24.10.15.25.25.7.9.9","25.24.28.31.27.31.18.29.28.33.32.16.32.32","9.16.15.12.15.17.11.14.12.12.12.10.14.14.15.15.10","19.14.19.19.15.15.13.14.12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,1095,3

Yet obtaining accurate estimates in the wild through direct observation can be challenging or even impossible, particularly over large spatial and temporal scales. Genotyping many individuals from wild populations can provide detailed inferences about dispersal. We therefore utilized genomewide marker data to estimate dispersal in the classic metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia L.), in the Aland Islands in SW Finland. This is an ideal system to test the effectiveness of this approach due to the wealth of information already available covering dispersal across small spatial and temporal scales, but lack of information at larger spatial and temporal scales. We sampled three larvae per larval family group from 3732 groups over a six-year period and genotyped for 272 SNPs across the genome. We used this empirical data set to reconstruct cases where full-sibs were detected in different local populations to infer female effective dispersal distance, that is, dispersal events directly contributing to gene flow. On average this was one kilometre, closely matching previous dispersal estimates made using direct observation. To evaluate our power to detect full-sib families, we performed forward simulations using an individual-based model constructed and parameterized for the Glanville fritillary metapopulation. Using these simulations, 100% of predicted full-sibs were correct and over 98% of all true full-sib pairs were detected. We therefore demonstrate that even in a highly dynamic system with a relatively small number of markers, we can accurately reconstruct full-sib families and for the first time make inferences on female effective dispersal. This highlights the utility of this approach in systems where it has previously been impossible to obtain accurate estimates of dispersal over both ecological and evolutionary scales.","toby.fountain@ebc.uu.se",2018,"10.1111/eva.12552","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","EG","AAS","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","Finland","Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik","2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2009.01.01,2010.01.01,2011.01.01,2012.01.01","114.259.495,37.80.187,49.63.835,21.22.456,34.99.2017,69.285.3200",365,"pre-designed","natural","","","",NA,"SNP","body",NA,"NucleoSpin 96 Tissue Core Kit (Macherey-Nagel)","KASP platform","RNA","Generation time: Hanski et al., 2017; no real driver or sample storage","2007.01.01","114.259.495","37.80.187","49.63.835","21.22.456","34.99.2017","69.285.3200",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5.0027397260274,1826,5.0027397260274

We used nine microsatellite loci and recently developed methods in landscape genetics and coalescence-based estimation of historical gene flow and effective population sizes to assess temporal and spatial dynamics of the population structure in European flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). We collected 1062 flounders from 13 localities in the northeast Atlantic and Baltic Seas and found temporally stable and highly significant genetic differentiation among samples covering a large part of the species' range (global F-ST = 0.024, P < 0.0001). In addition to historical processes, a number of contemporary acting evolutionary mechanisms were associated with genetic structuring. Physical forces, such as oceanographic and bathymetric barriers, were most likely related with the extreme isolation of the island population at the Faroe Islands. A sharp genetic break was associated with a change in life history from pelagic to benthic spawners in the Baltic Sea. Partial Mantel tests showed that geographical distance per se was not related with genetic structuring among Atlantic and western Baltic Sea samples. Alternative factors, such as dispersal potential and/or environmental gradients, could be important for generating genetic divergence in this region. The results show that the magnitude and scale of structuring generated by a specific mechanism depend critically on its interplay with other evolutionary mechanisms, highlighting the importance of investigating species with wide geographical and ecological distributions to increase our understanding of evolution in the marine environment.","jhh@difres.dk",2007,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03367.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","RC","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","Finland,Sweden,Denmark,UK,Netherlands,France,Norway","Turku,Turku,Gotland,Gotland,Bornholm,Bornholm,Ærø, Ærø ,Thyborøn,Thyborøn,Ringkøbing Fjord,Ringkøbing Fjord,The Limfjord,Irish Sea,Irish Sea,Westerschelde Estuary,Bay of Biscay,Bay of Biscay,Trondheim,Lake Pulmanki,Faeroe Islands,Faeroe Islands,Plaice","2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2004.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01","54,50,46,48,55,53,52,52,55,59,39,50,55,49,49,47,49,39,49,34,44,34,18",NA,"opportunistic","natural","","","","chronic","microsat",NA,NA,"HotSHOT, Chelex, DNEasy","Pharmacia ALFexpress","PCR","","2003.01.01","54","50","46","48","55","53","52","52","55","59","39","50","55","49",49,47,"49","39","49",34,44,"34","18",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland","Sweden","Denmark","UK","Netherlands","France","Norway",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,365,1

The aim of this study is to investigate population connectivity of P. argus at two levels: (1) spatially between two marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Caribbean coast of Mexico, and (2) temporally within MPAs; by genotyping discrete size classes lobsters using microsatellite markers. No evidence of population differentiation between lobster populations from Banco Chinchorro and Sian Ka'an MPAs was found (P= 0.139). In contrast significant levels of population differentiation among discrete size classes of lobsters was found (F-ST = 0.0054; P=0.0052). Temporal variation among the genotypes of new larval recruits may explain these results. Future research will be required to directly test the genotypes of new larval recruits in Banco Chinchorro and Sian Ka'an MPAs to confirm this hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Documented reintroduction of beavers in Poland has been conducted using animals of the eastern European origin, most likely derived from the eastern mtDNA lineage. However demographic and spatial expansion of beavers from Germany, which represent the western lineage, may have led to admixture of these two genetically distinct entities in Poland. We detected significant genetic differentiation between the populations from W and NE Poland both in mitochondrial DNA control region and microsatellites, but also substantial admixture including apparent first-generation migrants between regions. Our results indicate that beavers from the western mtDNA lineage have contributed considerably to the Polish population, particularly in W Poland. As there have been no adequately documented translocations of beavers from the western European populations to Poland, the observed situation appears to result from natural migration or range expansion from the west. In contrast to previous findings we detected a substantial diversity in mtDNA control region, which indicates that either the variation in relict populations has been underestimated, or that additional relict beaver populations survived at the end of the 19th century in Poland and Germany as indicated by considerable similarity of ancient and extant mtDNA haplotypes. The implications of our findings for beaver conservation and management are discussed. (C) 2014 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

For organisms living in fragmented habitats, population persistence may depend on dispersal, which maintains gene flow among fragments and can prevent inbreeding within them. It is centrally important to understand patterns of dispersal for bees living in fragmented areas given the importance of pollination systems and recently documented declines in bee populations. We used population and landscape genetic techniques to characterize patterns of dispersal over a large fragmented area in southern Costa Rica for the orchid bee species Euglossa championi. First, we estimated levels of genetic differentiation among forest fragments as (PT), an analog to the traditional summary statistic F-ST, as well as two statistics that may more adequately represent levels of differentiation, G'(ST) and D-est. Second, we used a Bayesian approach to determine the number and composition of genetic groups in our sample. Third we investigated how genetic differentiation changes with distance. Fourth, we determined the extent to which deforested areas restrict dispersal. Finally, we estimated the extent to which there were temporal differences in allele frequencies within the same forest fragments. Within years we found low levels of differentiation even over 80km, and no effect of land use type on level of genetic differentiation. However, we found significant genetic differentiation between years. Taken together our results suggest that there are high levels of gene flow over this geographic area, and that individuals show low site fidelity over time.","sssuni@eco.umass.edu",2014,"10.1111/btp.12084","BIOTROPICA","temporal-genetics","RC","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","CostaRica","Las Alturas,LC Station,Romero II,Osa,Las Alturas,LC Station,Romero II","2009,2009,2009,2010,2010,2010,2010","11,25,19,59,17,8,12",61,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","","","chronic","microsat","","","phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","would qualify but uses microsats, generation time from  https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.543","2009","11","25","19","59","17","8","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CostaRica",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping 10 microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from 8 different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.","sarah.leo@mail.mcgill.ca",2017,"10.1093/jhered/esw073","JOURNAL OF HEREDITY","temporal-genetics","RC","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","Canada","BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV,BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV,BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV,BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV","2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014","30,5,24,30,11,25,39,20,14,8,23,5,35,0,16,5,0,0,0,7,8,0,0,0,0,0,32,42,12,30,0,0,20,38,0,7,12,7,24,0,20,1,0,0,0,15,8,0,9,19,2,5",NA,"","natural","invasive_species","","","chronic","microsat","body","","phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","","2011","30","5","24","30","11","25","39","20","14","8","23","5","35","0",16,5,"0","0","0",7,8,"0","0","0",0,"0","32","42","12",30,"0","0",20,38,0,7,12,7,"24",0,20,1,0,0,0,15,8,0,"9",19,2,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These dynamic biological processes require monitoring with temporal environmental and landscape genetic data. We compared the spatial genetic variation of a relict, umbrella species, the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), in two different demographic periods, as represented by older museum specimens (1960-1990) and recent non-invasive samples (2011-2015) collected from the Carpathian Mountains, where habitat connectivity has dramatically decreased in the past decade. Using a combination of species distribution modelling and spatial genetic inference, we analysed how climatic and environmental constraints shaped population structures of the species. Environmental and climate niche models confirmed that relict Carpathian capercaillie populations are temperature sensitive, and they occur in a narrow range of mountain forest habitats at the highest altitudes. We found that the environmental and climatic constraints led to genetically isolated populations, but we also detected clusters that did not match relatively interrupted areas of niche habitats. We observed a similar disruption of gene flow in both periods; however, a stronger signal of genetic structuring in recent samples indicated that the processes negatively affecting connectivity are ongoing. The effective population size of the Carpathian population has declined in recent years, but it has been low for at least the last five decades in the Western Carpathians. This study demonstrates the importance of temporal ecological and genetic data as an effective warning tool for the conservation and management of wildlife species.","peter.klinga@tuzvo.sk",2020,"10.1007/s10592-020-01253-x","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","AAS","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Aves","Ukraine,Slovakia,Romania","","","",NA,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","habitat_loss","","chronic","microsat","tissue.feces.bones","ethanol","DNeasy Tissue Kit, DNA Stool kit (Qiagen)","","PCR","RC: not all stocked pops?, toe pads for museum, feathers and feces for modern.

Cultural inheritance of migration routes represents a mechanism whereby geographical isolation can arise between separate groups and could constrain individuals to potentially suboptimal sites within their range. Conversely, adopting the parental migratory route in adult life, rather than dispersing randomly, may increase an individual's reproductive success because that strategy has already been proven to allow successful breeding. We combined a pedigree of related light-bellied Brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) with 6 years of observations of marked birds to calculate the dispersal distances of adult offspring from their parents in both Ireland and Iceland. In both countries, the majority of offspring were found to recruit into or near their parental sites, indicating migratory connectivity in the flyway. Despite this kin structure, we found no evidence of genetic differentiation using genotype data from 1127 individuals across 15 microsatellite loci. We suggest that the existence of migratory connectivity of subpopulations is far more common than previous research indicates and that cultural information may play an important role in structuring reproductive isolation among them.","xavierh22@gmail.com; s.bearhop@ex.ac.uk",2010,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04852.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","historical-dna","AAS","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","terrestrial","Aves","Ireland","","","",2555,"opportunistic","natural","competition","","","","microsat","blood.tissue","ethanol","","","","*Microsats",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ireland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This species is a culturally important food fish in the Mariana Archipelago and subject to high fishing pressure. Our primary hypothesis was to test whether the individuals resident in the southern Mariana Island chain were genetically distinct and hence should be managed as discrete stocks. In addition to spatial sampling of adults, newly-settled individuals were sampled on Guam over four recruitment events to assess the temporal stability of the observed spatial patterns, and evidence of self-recruitment. We found significant genetic structure in S. spinus across the western Pacific, with Bayesian analyses revealing three genetically distinct clusters: the southern Mariana Islands, east Micronesia, and the west Pacific; with the southern Mariana Islands being more strongly differentiated from the rest of the region. Analyses of temporal samples from Guam indicated the southern Mariana cluster was stable over time, with no genetic differentiation between adults versus recruits, or between samples collected across four separate recruitment events spanning 11 months. Subsequent assignment tests indicated seven recruits had self-recruited from within the Southern Mariana Islands population. Our results confirm the relative isolation of the southern Mariana Islands population and highlight how local processes can act to isolate populations that, by virtue of their broad-scale distribution, have been subject to traditionally high gene flows. Our results add to a growing consensus that self-recruitment is a highly significant influence on the population dynamics of tropical reef fish.","markandrewpriest@hotmail.com",2012,"10.1002/ece3.260","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","temporal-genetics","AAS","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","USA","Achang,East Agana,Cocos,Agat,Governors,Ipan,Pago,Rios,Tanguisson,Achang,East Agana,Cocos,Agat,Governors,Ipan,Pago,Rios,Tanguisson,Achang,East Agana,Cocos,Agat,Governors,Ipan,Pago,Rios,Tanguisson,Achang,East Agana,Cocos,Agat,Governors,Ipan,Pago,Rios,Tanguisson","2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.11.07,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.07.08,2021.09f.08,2021.09.08,2021.09.08,2021.09.08,2021.09.08,2021.09.08,2021.09.08,2021.09.08,2021.09.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08,2021.10.08","20,16,0,13,0,13,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,19,0,21,0,20,26,19,22,48,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,8,23",183,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat","fin","ethanol","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","Sanger","PCR","lat/lon available, generation time from fishbase","2021.11.07","20","16","0","13","0","13","0","0","9","0","0","0","0","0",0,0,"15","19","0",21,0,"20","26","19",22,"48","19","0","0",0,"0","20",0,0,8,23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.666666666666667,122,0.334246575342466

Genetic samples collected from putative E. a. purpura (Early cohort) and cryptica (Late cohort) subpopulations show no evidence of genetic structure indicative of allochronic isolation in phylogenies of 26 mitochondrial DNA COI haplotypes and 18 nuclear ITS1 alleles. Analysis of molecular variance revealed 89% of mitochondrial DNA variation structured within and among subpopulations, with only 11% between the purportedly isolated subspecies. Analysis of isolation and migration indicated gene flow from the Early to Late cohort was 3 x greater than in the opposite direction. We conclude that, rather than two separate subspecies, Euphilotes ancilla exists in a network of partially interconnected subpopulations extending from 1750 to 3000 m across much of the Spring Mountains. Gene flow is related to the timing of adult flight and host plant flowering, contributing to the genetic variation in phenology necessary for evolutionary tracking of shifting flowering periods of larval host plants. Maintenance of connectivity and gene flow across the Spring Mountains is therefore essential for population persistence of both cohorts in the face of environmental change.","daniel.thompson@unlv.edu",2020,"10.1007/s10592-020-01254-w","CONSERVATION GENETICS","museum-dna","EG","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","USA","NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV","2012.05.02,2012.06.13,2015.06.16,2015.08.03,2015.08.04,2015.08.05,2015.08.08,2016.06.03,2017.06.23,2017.07.12,2017.07.17,2017.07.21,2017.08.06,2017.08.09,2017.08.23,2012.06.14,2012.06.18,2012.05.29,2012.06.19,2012.06.21,2012.06.24,2012.07.05,2012.08.05,2012.05.31,2013.06.19,2012.06.06,2013.07.30,2013.08.02,2013.08.05,2013.08.11,2014.08.03,2015.06.06,2015.04.10,2016.04.10","2,5,11,2,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,6,1,1,7,15,4,15,5,4,6,3,1,10,1,2,4,4,2,1,4,2,2",NA,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","","","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","","PCR","lat/lon available","2012.05.02","2","5","11","2","2","1","1","3","1","1","1","1","6","1",1,7,"15","4","15",5,4,"6","3","1",10,"1","2","4","4",2,"1","4",2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1939,5.31232876712329

However, how parasite population genetic structure is shaped by the interaction between host and parasite life history remains understudied. Studies comparing multiple parasites infecting a single host can be used to investigate how different parasite life history traits interplay with host behaviour and life history. In this study, we used 10 newly developed microsatellite loci to investigate the genetic structure of a parasitic bat fly (Basilia nana). Its host, the Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii), has a social system and roosting behaviour that restrict opportunities for parasite transmission. We compared fly genetic structure to that of the host and another parasite, the wing-mite, Spinturnix bechsteini. We found little spatial or temporal genetic structure in B.nana, suggesting a large, stable population with frequent genetic exchange between fly populations from different bat colonies. This contrasts sharply with the genetic structure of the wing-mite, which is highly substructured between the same bat colonies as well as temporally unstable. Our results suggest that although host and parasite life history interact to yield similar transmission patterns in both parasite species, the level of gene flow and eventual spatiotemporal genetic stability is differentially affected. This can be explained by the differences in generation time and winter survival between the flies and wing-mites. Our study thus exemplifies that the population genetic structure of parasites on a single host can vary strongly as a result of how their individual life history characteristics interact with host behaviour and life history traits.","jvschaik@orn.mpg.de",2015,"10.1111/mec.13171","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","EG","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","Germany","Blutsee,Blutsee,Blutsee,Brandtwiese,Brandtwiese,Brandtwiese,Einsiedel,Einsiedel,Guttenberg2,Guttenberg2,Gramschatz1,Gramschatz2,Hochberg,Steinbach,Stalldorf,Stalldorf","2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2011.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2011.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2003.01.01,2011.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01","12,13,13,17,38,16,24,27,14,42,12,12,36,9,26,21",NA,"pre-designed","natural","disease","","","chronic","microsat","body","ethanol","salting-out","","PCR","this is a temporal study (looks interesting too) but data is microsats + allozymes","2002.01.01","12","13","13","17","38","16","24","27","14","42","12","12","36","9",26,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3287,9.00547945205479

In this study the pattern of gene flow between the two Atlantic stocks of the European hake has been examined for the period 2000-2002. Present analyses indicate that a large genetic homogeneity existed among all Atlantic populations in that period, and that a systematic grouping occurred between Porcupine Bank samples and Cantabric ones. This scenario is congruent with an inter-annual gene flow from central grounds of the northern stock (Porcupine and Great Sole) to Iberian grounds inhabited by the southern stock. Additionally, estimated migration figures were in agreement with the good recruitments observed in the southern stock after 2003 despite the spawning biomass was at its historical minimum. Altogether these results highlight the central role of Porcupine bank and Great Sole in making sustainable both stocks and advocate the integrative management of this hake fishery by means of a multidisciplinary assessment.

While previous work has shown that population structure is shaped by many biological processes, few studies have investigated how these factors vary over time. Consequently, we explored the fine-scale spatiotemporal genetic structure of an intensively studied population of cooperatively breeding banded mongooses (Mungos mungo) over a 10-year period. Overall population structure was strong (average FST=0.129) but groups with spatially overlapping territories were not more genetically similar to one another than noncontiguous groups. Instead, genetic differentiation was associated with historical group-fission (budding) events, with new groups diverging from their parent groups over time. Within groups, relatedness was high within but not between the sexes, although the latter increased over time since group formation due to group founders being replaced by philopatric young. This trend was not mirrored by a decrease in average offspring heterozygosity over time, suggesting that close inbreeding may often be avoided, even when immigration into established groups is virtually absent and opportunities for extra-group matings are rare. Fine-scale spatiotemporal population structure could have important implications in social species, where relatedness between interacting individuals is a vital component in the evolution of patterns of inbreeding avoidance, reproductive skew and kin-selected helping and harming.","H.J.Nichols@ljmu.ac.uk",2012,"10.1111/mec.12015","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KJ","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","Uganda","Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda","2000.01.01,2001.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2005.01.01,2006.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2009.01.01","161,271,220,232,302, 288, 273, 241,285,249",NA,"opportunistic","natural","competition","","","","microsat","skin","","","Sanger","PCR","","2000.01.01","161","271","220","232","302"," 288"," 273"," 241","285","249",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Uganda",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3288,9.00821917808219

Here, we sequence restriction site-associated DNA to characterize genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a broadly distributed and highly migratory large pelagic fish, striped marlin (Kajikia audax). Assessment of over 4,000 SNPs resolved spatiotemporal patterns of genetic connectivity throughout the species range in the Pacific and, for the first time, Indian oceans. Individual-based cluster analyses identified six genetically distinct populations corresponding with the western Indian, eastern Indian, western South Pacific, and eastern central Pacific oceans, as well as two populations in the North Pacific Ocean (F-ST = 0.0137-0.0819). F-ST outlier analyses identified a subset of SNPs (n = 59) putatively under the influence of natural selection and capable of resolving populations separated by comparatively high degrees of genetic differentiation. Temporal collections available for some regions demonstrated the stability of allele frequencies over three to five generations of striped marlin. Relative migration rates reflected lower levels of genetic connectivity between Indian Ocean populations (m(R) <= 0.37) compared with most populations in the Pacific Ocean (m(R) >= 0.57) and highlight the importance of the western South Pacific in facilitating gene flow between ocean basins. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into rangewide population structure for striped marlin and highlight substantial inconsistencies between genetically distinct populations and stocks currently recognized for fisheries management. More broadly, we demonstrate that species capable of longdistance dispersal in environments lacking obvious physical barriers to movement can display substantial population subdivision that persists over multiple generations and that may be facilitated by both neutral and adaptive processes. Importantly, surveys of genome-wide markers enable inference of population-level relationships using sample sizes practical for large pelagic fishes of conservation concern.","mamooz@msu.edu",2020,"10.1111/eva.12892","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genomics","KJ","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","SouthAfrica,SouthAfrica,SouthAfrica,SouthAfrica,NewZealand,Taiwan,Taiwan,Taiwan,USA,USA,Ecuador,Ecuador","","2017.01.01,2016.01.01,2015.01.01,2016.01.01,2017.01.01,2016.01.01,2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2016.01.01,2000.01.01,2016.01.01,1992.01.01","",913,"opportunistic","natural","","","","","SNP","muscle","ethanol","DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)","Illumina_HiSeq","RAD","generation time from fishbase","2017.01.01",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SouthAfrica","SouthAfrica","SouthAfrica","SouthAfrica","NewZealand","Taiwan","Taiwan","Taiwan","USA","USA","Ecuador","Ecuador",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.0021905805038,9132,25.0191780821918

Spawning adults from a Chilean (Pacific) spawning site and three feeding ground samples (one from Chile and two temporal samples from the Falkland Islands (Atlantic)) were analysed. The data indicated a high level of Atlantic/Pacific connectivity by means of non-natal homing of individuals to spawning aggregations. Against this background of regional connectivity however, genetic data support the existence of a reproductively isolated population within the overwintering stock. Otolith core results are compatible with reproductive isolation being effected by natal homing to an Atlantic spawning site and/or local adaptation. The discordance between geopolitically defined Atlantic and Pacific management stocks and underlying biocomplexity, and implications for sustainability, are discussed. The study highlights the importance of intraspecific variation in homing behaviours in shaping population structure and the merit of employing complementary analytical approaches.

Historically, native red foxes occurred in subalpine zones of the Cascade, Rocky, and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, and in the desert-like Sacramento Valley of California. The origins of red foxes observed in the Intermountain West since the early 1900s are unclear, potentially representing native population relicts from the last ice age, dispersers from adjacent mountain populations, or early fur-farm escapees. These foxes carry a native 696-bp mitochondrial haplotype (A-19), which was also the most basal and widespread among western populations and thus equally consistent with ancient and contemporary origins. Here, to increase resolution, we sequenced an additional 3,308 bp (totaling 4,004 bp) of the mitochondrial genome corresponding to A-19 and related haplotypes (O-24 and D-19) from historical and modern samples collected throughout western North America. The expanded sequences revealed previously undocumented haplotype diversity, including another novel mutation associated with the D-19 matriline endemic to the Sacramento Valley, confirming its ancient divergence. We observed 6 A-19 variants falling into 2 divergent subclades. Although no A-19 variants were unique to the Intermountain West, the 2 dominant ones were rare elsewhere, and an analysis of molecular variance supported the distinctiveness of this population. Our findings suggest this population was either an ancient relict or derived from a small founder group from a neighboring mountain range. Additional sampling and high-density nuclear genomic markers can further clarify origins of these animals, including potential nonnative introgression.","bnsacks@ucdavis.edu",2015,"10.1093/jmammal/gyv007","JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY","ancient-dna","KJ","KC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","","","",NA,"opportunistic","natural","invasive_species","env_variation","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","tissue.feces.bones","","","","","unable to download supplement...",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In 1996 (a wet year) and 1999 (a dry year), we sampled mosquitofish at 20 dry-season refuges distributed in 3 water management regions and characterized genetic variation for 10 allozyme and 3 microsatellite loci. In 1996, most of the ecosystem did not dry, whereas in 1999, many of our sampling locations were isolated by expanses of dried marsh surface. In 1996, most spatial genetic variation was attributed to heterogeneity within regions. In 1999, spatial genetic variation within regions was not significant. In both years, a small but significant amount of variation (less than 1% of the total variation) was partitioned among regions. Variance was consistently greater than zero among long-hydroperiod sites within a region, but not among short-hydroperiod sites within a region, where hydroperiod was measured as time since last marsh surface dry-down forcing fishes into local refuges. In 1996, all sites were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In 1999, we observed fewer heterozygotes than expected for most loci and sites suggesting a Wahlund effect arising from fish leaving areas that dried and mixing in deep-water refuges.","tmcelro2@kennesaw.edu",2011,"10.1093/jhered/esr088","JOURNAL OF HEREDITY","temporal-genetics","EG","RC","accept","accept","empirical","connectivity","diversity","","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","WCA.3A_1,WCA.3A_2,WCA.3A_3,WCA.3A_4,WCA.3A_5,WCA.3A_6,WCA.3A_7,SRS_8,SRS_9,SRS_10,SRS_11,SRS_12,SRS_13,SRS_14,TS_15,TS_16,TS_17,TS_18,TS_19,TS_20","1999.03.01,1996.03.01","32.32.32.30.20.18.31.32.31.33.32.32.32.32.32.32.24.34.32.32,31.25.31.30.29.30.26.22.28.29.28.29.31.22.23.19.21.28.30.29",182,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","acute","microsat","muscle","frozen","phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","sampling lat/lon provided in supplemental material (Dryad dataset), RC: moved to connectivity bc talks mostly about how pop structure changed in dry v. wet years","1999.03.01","32.32.32.30.20.18.31.32.31.33.32.32.32.32.32.32.24.34.32.32","31.25.31.30.29.30.26.22.28.29.28.29.31.22.23.19.21.28.30.29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6.01648351648352,1095,3

Temporal patterns of genetic characteristics of salmon from northern Spain, the southernmost European populations, were compared before and after species decline and heavy stocking with specimens from northern Europe. Eleven microsatellite loci were analysed in archival (scales from 1958-1960) and contemporary (2007-2008) samples from the River Sella. Temporal analyses revealed a similar heterozygosity between archival and contemporary samples, despite a drastic decrease in population abundance, while the contemporary sample showed a higher allelic richness due to the occurrence of foreign alleles. Considering only the alleles with at least 4 % frequency in the archival sample, 2 alleles exclusive to the River Sella were absent in the contemporary sample, and 14 alleles showed a decrease of at least 4 % frequency. Four alleles common in Scotland showed a high occurrence in the contemporary sample, so they are good candidates as markers of introgression of foreign genes. The heavy stocking with non-native Scottish broodstocks between 1970 and 1990 caused the introgression found in the contemporary sample when compared with the pristine population. An abrupt decrease was evident when the estimates of effective number of breeders were adjusted to take into account overlapping generations (Nb-Adj), effective population size (Ne-Adj) estimated from Nb-Adj, and number of breeders estimated using the sibship assignment method (Nb-SIB) The very low effective size values found in the contemporary sample, together with the detrimental synergy between genetic drift and high rates of introgression, represent a severe risk for the conservation of native salmon.","aalmodovar@bio.ucm.es",2020,"10.3354/esr01029","ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH","temporal-genetics","KJ","JW","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","other","Actinopterygii","Spain","River Sella","2008.01.01,2007.01.01,1960.01.01,1959.01.01,1958.01.01","(m)172,(h)146",1022,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","","","","chronic","microsat","fin clips, scales","not reported","Chelex resin protocol (Estoup et al. 1996),QIAamp DNA Mini Kit","Sanger","PCR","generation time: Consuegra et al 2005, present study","2008.01.01","(m)172","(h)146",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17.8688845401174,18262,50.0328767123288

In this study, we used direct sequencing of mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (28S and ITS) genes to compare genetic differences in presumed native and introduced populations in order to infer its introduction pattern and to shed light on the native range of this species. The temporal pattern of genetic diversity at the westernmost limit of the geographic range of P. pusilla in Europe (the Atlantic coast of southern Spain) over an eight-year period was also investigated. Our results confirm P. pusilla as a neocosmopolitan species and suggest that the species is native to the Atlantic coast of Central and South America. Paracaprella pusilla seems to have been introduced into European waters from multiple introduction pathways and source populations, which are likely to include populations from coastal waters of Brazil. Multiple introduction pathways may have been involved, with the most important being commercial shipping through the Strait of Gibraltar. While this tropical species appears to be expanding in the Mediterranean, populations from the westernmost limit of its geographic range in Europe showed a temporal instability. This study constitutes the first molecular approach focused on this species, but it is also the first study of temporal change in genetic diversity of any introduced marine amphipod. Additional intensive sampling of this species, including both native and non-native populations, and detailed temporal studies are still necessary to properly understand how genetic diversity influences the introduction and survival of P. pusilla in invaded areas.","pilarcabezas@cibio.up.pt",2019,"10.3897/neobiota.47.32408","NEOBIOTA","temporal-genetics","AAS","JW","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","marine","Amphipoda","Spain,Tunisia,Israel,Australia,Brazil,Mexico","","","",NA,"","","","","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Spain","Tunisia","Israel","Australia","Brazil","Mexico",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This so-called genetic monitoring was conducted across 12 consecutive years (19962007) at three sites for the feral cat, introduced onto the Kerguelen archipelago fifty years ago. Temporal changes in allelic richness and heterozygosity at 18 microsatellite DNA loci were compared with temporal changes in the adult population abundance index, obtained by typical demographic monitoring. No association was found at the island spatial scale, but we observed an association between genetic diversity and adult population indices from year to year within each study site. More particularly, the magnitude of successive increases or decreases in the adult population abundance index appeared to be the major factor linking the trajectories of genetic diversity and adult population abundance indices. Natal dispersal and/or local recruitment, both facilitated by high juvenile survival when the adult population size is small, is proposed as the major demographic processes contributing to such an observed pattern. Finally, we suggested avoiding the use of the harmonic mean as an estimator of long-term population size to study the relationships between demographic fluctuations and heterozygosity in populations characterized by strong multiannual density fluctuations.","sebastien.devillard@univ-lyon1.fr",2011,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05329.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","ACS","JW","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","connectivity","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","France","Grande Terre","2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1997.01.01,1996.01.01","13,6,32,65,66,16,10,16,30,41,26,24",334,"pre-designed","natural","competition","","","acute","microsat","","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","generation time: https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/82598","2007.01.01","13","6","32","65","66","16","10","16","30","41","26","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"France",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12.0299401197605,4018,11.0082191780822

Here, we used DNA recovered from a temporal series of archived North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, to investigate genetic diversity within the Flamborough Head population between 1954 and 1998, during which time the population underwent two successive declines. Microsatellite data indicated a significant reduction in genetic diversity between 1954 and 1970 (total number of alleles: 1954, 46; 1960, 42; 1970, 37), and a subsequent recovery between 1970 and 1998 (total number of alleles: 1970, 37; 1981, 42; 1998, 45). Furthermore, estimates of genetic differentiation (F-ST and R-ST) showed a significant divergence between 1998 and earlier samples. Data are consistent with a period of prolonged genetic drift, accompanied by a replacement of the Flamborough Head population through an increased effective migration rate that occurred during a period of high exploitation and appreciable demographic and phenotypic change. Other studies indicate that diversity at neutral microsatellite loci may be correlated with variability at selected genes, thus compromising a population's subsequent recovery and adaptive potential. Such effects are especially pertinent to North Sea cod, which are threatened by continuing exploitation and rising sea temperatures.","w.f.hutchinson@hull.ac.uk",2003,"10.1098/rspb.2003.2493","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","ancient-dna","KF","JW","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","adaptation","","","","marine","Actinopterygii","UK","FlamboroughHead,SouthernBight,FlamboroughHead,FlamboroughHead,FlamboroughHead,FlamboroughHead","2000.05.01,1998.01.01,1981.01.01,1970.01.01,1960.01.01,1954.01.01","72,72,72,72,72,72",2738,"opportunistic","both","human_exploitation","climate_change","","acute","microsat","otolith","dried","Hutchinson et al 1999","Sanger","PCR","microsatellite; Gen time: fishbase","2000.05.01","72","72","72","72","72","72",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UK",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6.18042366691015,16922,46.3616438356164

In recent years natural populations have come under considerable pressure due to overharvesting and ecological shifts. The spatial genetic structure of H. midae has been determined; however there has not been a temporal assessment of abalone population dynamics around the South African coast. Using a population genomics approach this study aimed to assess fluctuations in genetic diversity among wild and cultured South African abalone populations through time and space. Various estimates of genetic diversity and population differentiation were calculated using EST-derived SNP markers. All populations had comparable levels of genetic diversity and the long-term effective population size appears to be sufficiently large for the wild populations, despite evidence of recent bottlenecks. Population differentiation was for the most part geographically correlated, with spatial genetic structure maintained across temporal samples. Significant genetic differentiation was, however, detected among temporal samples taken from the same locality. There was evidence for comparatively small short-term effective population sizes that could explain large changes in allele frequencies due to stochastic effects. Temporal heterogeneity could also be explained by changes in selection pressures over time. H. midae populations could, therefore, be more dynamic than previously estimated and this could have implications for effective conservation and fisheries management.","clintr@sun.ac.za",2017,"10.1007/s10592-016-0879-5","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","BR","JW","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","connectivity","adaptation","","marine","Gastropoda","SouthAfrica","Witsand.Cape Recife.Riet Point,Saldanha Bay,Witsand.Saldanha Bay,Gansbaai.Riet Point,Cape Recife","2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2000.01.01","9.30.32,31,33.48,24.51,19",2190,"pre-designed","both","env_variation","climate_change","human_exploitation","","SNP","muscle,gills","ethanol","CTAB","Illumina_BeadXpress","","generation time: Rhode et al 2017.","2011.01.01","9.30.32","31","33.48","24.51","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SouthAfrica",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.83470319634703,4018,11.0082191780822

However, determining whether a natural system fits a metapopulation model is a complex issue. Extinction-colonization dynamics are indeed often difficult to quantify because species detectability is not always 100%, resulting in an imperfect record of extinctions. Here, we explore whether combining population genetics with demographic and ecological surveys can yield more realistic estimates of metapopulation dynamics. We apply this approach to the freshwater snail Drepanotrema depressissimum in a fragmented landscape of tropical ponds. In addition to studying correlations between genetic diversity and demographical or ecological characteristics, we undertake, for the first time, a detailed search for genetic signatures of extinctionrecolonization events using temporal changes in allele frequencies within sites. Surprisingly, genetic data indicate that extinction is much rarer than suggested by demographic surveys. Consequently, this system is better described as a set of populations with different sizes and immigration rates than as a true metapopulation. We identify several cases of apparent extinction owing to nondetection of low-density populations, and of aestivating individuals in desiccated ponds. More generally, we observed a frequent mismatch between genetic and demographical/ecological information at small spatial and temporal scales. We discuss the causes of these discrepancies and show how these two types of data provide complementary information on population dynamics and history, especially when temporal genetic samples are available.","thomas.lamy27@gmail.com",2012,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05478.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","AAS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","","freshwater","Gastropoda","Guadeloupe","Pico,Grosse Roche,Senneville,Valet Est,Geffner,Rejouri Nord,L'Ecluse,Couronne Conchou,Fond Rose,Mahaudiere,Pistolet,Porte Enfer Vigie","01.01.2011,01.01.2009,01.01,2008,01.01,2007,01.01.2006","32.29.31.30,32.30.30.22.32.31.30.32,31.32.31,24.32.30.32.29.31,34.32.32.31.29.31.31.31",60,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat",NA,"ethanol","chelex","Sanger","PCR","Pico sampled in 09, 07 & 06, Grosse Roche sampled in 07 & 06, Senneville sampled in 07 & 06, Valet Est sampled in 08-06, Geffner sampled in 09-06, Rejouri Nord sampled in 08-06, L'Ecluse sampled in 09 & 06, Couronne Conchou sampled in 09 & 06, Fond Rose sampled in 11 & 09, Mahaudiere sampled in 11 & 09, Pistolet sampled in 11 & 09, Porte Enfer Vigie sampled in 11 & 09","01.01.2011","32.29.31.30","32.30.30.22.32.31.30.32","31.32.31","24.32.30.32.29.31","34.32.32.31.29.31.31.31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Guadeloupe",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0

Nevertheless, marine organisms may show restricted dispersal in time and space. Patterns of isolation by distance (IBD) have been repeatedly observed in marine species. If spawning time is a function of geographical location, temporal and spatial isolation, can easily be confounded or misinterpreted. In this study, we aimed at discriminating between various forces shaping the genetic composition of recruiting juveniles of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.). By controlling for geographical variation, we assessed temporal variation and tested for possible isolation by time (IBT) between recruitment waves within and between years. Using 12 polymorphic allozyme and six variable microsatellite loci, we show that genetic differentiation was low (F-ST = 0.01-0.002) and significant between temporal samples. Regression analysis between genetic and temporal distance, was consistent with a subtle interannual pattern of IBT. Our data suggest that the population dynamics of the European eel may be governed by a double pattern of temporal variance in genetic composition: (i) a broad-scale IBT of spawning cohorts, possibly as a consequence of the large migration loop in anguillids and strong variance in annual adult reproductive contribution; and (ii) a smaller-scale variance in reproductive success (genetic patchiness) within cohorts among seasonally separated spawning groups, most likely originating from fluctuating oceanic and climatic forces. The consistency of both mechanisms remains to be verified with fine-scale analyses of both spawning/migrating aged adults and their offspring to confirm the stochastic/deterministic nature of the IBT pattern in eel.","gregory.maes@bio.kuleuven.be",2006,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02925.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","other","Actinopterygii","Iceland,Ireland,Netherlands,France,Morocco","Vogslaeker,Burrishoole,Den Oever,Loire estuary,Tour du Valat,Oved Sebou","01.06.2003,01.05.2003,01.04.2003.01.03.2003,01.07.2002,01.05.2002,01.03.2002,01.02.2002,01.01.2002,01.07.2001,01.06.2001,01.04.2001,01.01.2001,01.05.1999","52,60,60,60.60,60,60.60,60,60,60,60,60.60,60,60,60",3248.5,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat","fin,muscle","ethanol, frozen","chelex","Sanger","PCR","Vogslaeker sampled in 6.2003, 7.2002, & 7.2001, Burrishoole sampled in 4.2003, 3.2002 & 6.2001, Den Oever sampled in 5.2003, 5.2002 & 6.2001, Loire estuary sampled in 3.20003, 1.2002 & 4.2001, Tour du Valat sampled in 3.2003, 2.2002 & 1.2001, Oved Sebou sampled in 5.2001 & 5.1999; generation time pulled from: https://www.fishbase.de/summary/35","01.06.2003","52","60","60","60.60","60","60.60","60","60","60","60","60.60","60","60","60",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Iceland","Ireland","Netherlands","France","Morocco",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.0464829921502232,151,0.413698630136986

Stocking can homogenize population structure, impede local adaptation, and hinder the use of genetic stock identification as a fishery management tool. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we evaluate the spatiotemporal genetic structure of 16 anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations in Maine, USA, to determine whether inter-basin stocking practices have influenced population structure and the genetic diversity of the species in this region. Although, no pre-supplementation samples exist, comparative analyses of stocked and non-stocked populations show that stock transfers have influenced alewife population genetic structure. Genetic isolation by distance (IBD) was non-significant among stocked populations, but significant among non-stocked populations. However, two populations, Dresden Mills and Sewell Pond, appear to have resisted genetic homogenization despite stocking. Non-significant genic and genetic differentiations were broadly distributed among alewife populations. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated highly significant differentiation among temporal replicates within populations, and Bayesian clustering analysis revealed weak population structure. A significant correlation was observed between stocking (time and events) and pairwise among alewife collections, and an analysis of IBD residuals showed a significant decline in the amount of genetic differentiation among populations as the extent of stocking activity increased. These findings call for an increased awareness of evolutionary processes and genetic consequences of restoration activities such as inter-basin stock transfers by fisheries management and conservation practitioners.","megsmcbride@gmail.com",2015,"10.1007/s10592-015-0733-1","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","BR","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","","other","Actinopterygii","USA","Orland Dam,Veazie Dam,Souadabscook Falls,Nequasset Lake Dam","2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01","53.52.61.43,60.52.60.60,71.60.59",547.5,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","","chronic","microsat","fin","ethanol","Elphinstone et al. 2003","Sanger","PCR","Orland Dam only sampled in 2010 & 2011; generation time pulled from Palkovacs 2007 Mol.

It is important for the success of these efforts that captive populations are genetically representative of wild source populations, and that genetic diversity is maintained over time. Our study presents SNP data from wild and captive populations of the critically endangered Australian orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster). We examine the genetic effects of a decision made in the 2010/2011 breeding season to recruit half of the juvenile cohort (n = 21), from a wild population in decline, to supplement an existing captive program. We report that heterozygosity among wild birds decreased in the years after this action. Following multiple releases of captive-reared birds back into the wild (occurring annually since 2013), captive and wild populations have attained similar overall levels of heterozygosity, and genetic differentiation between these populations is low. Parentage analyses confirm that captive-bred released individuals have successfully paired with wild birds and produced offspring. Our study suggests that translocation of wild individuals into captivity, from wild populations in decline, can potentially have deleterious lasting impacts on genetic diversity levels in these populations. However, our data also confirm that in captivity, founder diversity can be successfully preserved over time, and addition of wild founders can improve captive population health. The genetic diversity retained in captive populations can also be reintroduced to wild populations at a later date, provided that captive-release individuals are able to reproductively contribute to their recipient population.","carolyn.hogg@sydney.edu.au",2020,"10.1007/s10592-020-01292-4","CONSERVATION GENETICS","museum-dna","BR","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Aves","Australia","Australia","2016.01.01,2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,2011.01.01","28,15,26,4,16",730,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","invasive_species","","chronic","SNP","blood","dry,Queen's lysis buffer","Bioline Isolate II genomic DNA kit,Chelex","Illumina_HiSeq","SNP_array","2011 represents 2011-2012, 2013 represents 2013-2014, 2014 represents 2014-2015, 2015 represents 2015-2016, 2016 represents 2016-2017; generation time pulled from Garnett & Crowley (2000) The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000","2016.01.01","28","15","26","4","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.5013698630137,1826,5.0027397260274

A powerful approach to assess patterns and processes of genetic erosion is via ancient DNA techniques. Herein, we analyzed mtDNA from historical samples (1800s to present) of Andean Condors (Vultur gryphus) to investigate whether contemporary low genetic variability is the result of recent human expansion and persecution, and compared this genetic history to that of California condors (Gymnogyps californianus).We then explored historic demographies for both species via coalescent simulations. We found that Andean condors have lost at least 17% of their genetic variation in the early 20th century. Unlike California condors, however, low mtDNA diversity in the Andean condor was mostly ancient, before European arrival. However, we found that both condor species shared similar demographies in that population bottlenecks were recent and co-occurred with the introduction of livestock to the Americas and the global collapse of marine mammals. Given the combined information on genetic and demographic processes, we suggest that the protection of key habitats should be targeted for conserving extant genetic diversity and facilitate the natural recolonization of lost territories, while nuclear genomic data should be used to inform translocation plans.","padrojulian@gmail.com",2020,"10.1002/ece3.6887","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","ancient-dna","JW","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Aves","Argentina,Venezuela,Chile,Ecuador,Peru,Colombia,Bolivia","South America","1987.01.01,1915.01.01","38,35",2555,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","feather,toe,skin,bone",NA,"QIAamp kit","Sanger","PCR","1987 represents 1961-2013, 1915 represents 1884-1946 (historical samples occurred before/during decline & range contraction in Andean condors & don't contain any individuals that could be alive today)","1987.01.01","38","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Argentina","Venezuela","Chile","Ecuador","Peru","Colombia","Bolivia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.292759295499,26298,72.0493150684931

A fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was sequenced for 291 colonies of one population in Plymouth, UK, which was monitored for 9 yr after its initial discovery. A total of 238 colonies from 12 localities were also sequenced for population structure analyses. The temporal monitoring of the Plymouth population showed a progressive loss of genetic diversity over time attributable to a strong initial bottleneck followed by genetic drift and/or selection. Population genetic structure was consistent with the historical records of this introduction, which probably originated from oyster farming activities in France, from where the species spread to the UK and Spain. Only one population in France displayed high levels of genetic diversity, and most of the remaining populations presented very low variability. In addition, significant differentiation in terms of allele frequencies was detected between some populations. P. japonica has suffered a loss of genetic diversity in both space and time since its introduction, but this did not prevent its expansion. Accidental human transport is the most likely mechanism of spread within the introduced range. Asexual propagation modes and chimerism in this species may play an important role in introduction events. The genetic data presented here can contribute to the design of more efficient management methods for this and similar introduced-species.","perezportela@ceab.csic.es",2012,"10.3354/meps09560","MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES","temporal-genetics","EG","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","marine","Ascidiacea","UK","Plymouth","2007.09.01,2006.09.01,2005.09.01,2004.09.01,2003.09.01,2002.09.01,2001.09.01,2000.09.01,1999.09.01","44,49,46,50,34,19,20,24,5",NA,"pre-designed","both","invasive_species","env_variation","","chronic","mtDNA_seq",NA,"ethanol,EDTA","CTAB buffer & chloroform-isoamyl (Doyle & Doyle 1987)","Sanger","PCR","","2007.09.01","44","49","46","50","34","19","20","24","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UK",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2922,8.00547945205479

The species is listed as vulnerable because of fisheries-related mortality due to entanglement in set nets. The vulnerability of this species is further increased by its fidelity to local natal ranges and the genetic isolation of regional populations. Here we present evidence, based on 108 contemporary samples and 55 historical samples dating back to 1870, of a significant loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity in two regional populations of Hector's dolphin. The haplotype diversity (h) was calculated from sequences of a 206 bp fragment in the mtDNA control region, designed to identify 13 out of the 14 known maternal lineages. Over the last 20 years, the North Island population has been reduced from at least three lineages (h = 0.41) to a single lineage (h = 0; P < 0.05). Given its small size, reproductive isolation and reduced genetic diversity, this population is likely to become extinct. The diversity of the East Coast South Island population has declined significantly from h = 0.65 to h = 0.35 (p < 0.05). Based on trend analysis of the mtDNA diversity, we predict that the East Coast population will lose all mtDNA diversity within the next 20 years. This time-series of reduction in genetic variation provides independent evidence of the severity of population decline and habitat contraction resulting from fisheries and perhaps other human activities.","cs.baker@auckland.ac.nz",2000,"10.1098/rspb.2000.0972","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","historical-dna","RC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","marine","Mammalia","NewZealand","New Zealand","1993.01.01,1928.01.01","108,55",4562.5,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","bone,teeth",NA,"silica",NA,"PCR","1928 represents 1870-1987, 1993 represents 1988-1998 (split samples pre & post 1980 bc that's when commercial fishing practices changed to reduce dolphin bycatch); generation time pulled from Slooten (2011) Canadian J. of Zoology","1993.01.01","108","55",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NewZealand",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5.20372602739726,23742,65.0465753424658

We evaluated the genetic structure and diversity of a P. nasuta population from samples collected during a 6 year demographic study that encompassed a cyclical fluctuation in abundance. Genetic diversity was higher compared to other studies on bandicoot species suggesting the population is not genetically impoverished. We detected significant temporal genetic differentiation suggesting turnover of genotypes. There was no strong evidence for population structuring, indicating a panmictic population. Individual-based spatial autocorrelation analysis generated a similar pattern of relatedness across geographical distances for both sexes suggesting no or limited sex-biased dispersal.

Within estuaries, genotype frequencies may reflect past hybridisation events, with genetically intermediate and backcrossed individuals contributing to persistent hybrid swarms. In southeastern Australia, hybridisation has occurred between estuarine black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri and marine yellowfin bream A. australis, but it is unclear whether this reflects a contemporary process. We recently found that, within lakes and lagoons at the southern range limit of A. australis, hybrids were abundant and A. butcheri extremely rare, and surprisingly, we detected hybrids within a small sample of fish from the Gippsland Lakes, an estuary 250 km further south. In the present study, we compare the genotypic composition of the contemporary Gippsland Lakes population of Acanthopagrus spp. with the historical composition revealed by analysis of museum specimens. The genetic makeup of samples varied little over time, with ancestral A. butcheri virtually absent, and most introgressed individuals matching expectation for later-generation hybrids or A. butcheri backcrosses, suggesting that the lakes have supported persistent hybrid swarms. At each sampling time, the samples were genetically diverse, as measured by mean number of alleles per locus, which ranged from 8.2 to 9.2, and expected heterozygosity (He), which ranged from 0.66 to 0.70; however, we detected little allelic differentiation (F-ST = 0.003) across sampling times.

Insight into these processes is now achieved by analyses of genetic diversity allowing the past and present condition of populations to be assessed and compared. Given its severe fragmentation and small size, the population of the Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus in Poland can be regarded as especially prone to gene-pool alteration. Moreover, this is a region of Europe in which different genetic lineages of the Capercaillie may be present, ensuring that certain conservation decisions may be even more difficult than they otherwise would be. Bearing the above in mind, we decided to study polymorphism of the mitochondrial DNA Control Region (mtDNA CR) in remnant and extinct populations of the Capercaillie in Poland. The extinct population was represented by samples from birds hunted in the Lower Silesian Forest (SW Poland) between 1951-1962. We compared sequences obtained with data from the large, continuous population present in Russia and Scandinavia. Analysing 331 bp of mtDNA CR for 168 individuals, we identified 24 haplotypes, among which only 6 had not been reported previously in the species according to GenBank. Our data confirmed a previous suggestion regarding the genetic structure of the species in Poland, i.e. that birds from Augustow Forest (NE Poland) are related to Russian and Scandinavian populations, constituting a part of the lowland group within the boreal lineage. The Carpathian population is in turn confirmed as an independent genetic group within the boreal lineage, while specimens from the Solska Forest (SE Poland) prove to be highly differentiated from birds in other Polish populations; most likely because they derive from or have been connected via gene flow with - birds present in the Balkans. Further genetic analysis is necessary to resolve this evolutionary relationship between Capercaillies from south-eastern Poland and those of the Balkans. Where practice is concerned, the overall advice is that three Conservation Units are to be recognised in Poland. In addition to those, the extinct population from the Lower Silesian Forest has been deemed part of the lowland group within the boreal lineage, albeit a distinctive one, given the possibility of gene exchange with Carpathian birds. We further suggest that some aspect of this extinct population's genetic diversity reflects an uncontrolled process of reintroduction taking place in the past.","robertrut@miiz.waw.pl",2017,"10.3161/00016454AO2017.52.2.006","ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA","historical-dna","BR","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","popsize","","","terrestrial","Aves","Poland","Lower Silesian Forest","2003.01.01,1955.01.01","5,10",2336,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","feather","dried","Sherlock AX kit","Sanger","PCR","1955 represents 1950-1960; generation time pulled from: http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/western-capercaillie-tetrao-urogallus/details","2003.01.01","5","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Poland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7.50513698630137,17532,48.0328767123288

However, using contemporary genetic data to infer the dynamics of genetic diversity may be at risk of a bias, as inferences are performed from a set of extant populations, setting aside unavailable, rare, or now extinct lineages. Here, we took advantage of new developments in next-generation sequencing to analyze the spatial and temporal genetic dynamics of the grasshopper Oedaleus decorus, a steppic Southwestern-Palearctic species. We applied a recently developed hybridization capture (hyRAD) protocol that allows retrieving orthologous sequences even from degraded DNA characteristic of museum specimens. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in 68 historical and 51 modern samples in order to (i) unravel the spatial genetic structure across part of the species distribution and (ii) assess the loss of genetic diversity over the past century in Swiss populations. Our results revealed (i) the presence of three potential glacial refugia spread across the European continent and converging spatially in the Alpine area.

This observation is compatible with an increase in the bottleneck magnitude experienced by central European populations of O.decorus following human-mediated land-use change impacting steppic habitats.

Average haplotype diversity (Hd) was high (> 0.88) in 2005 and 2006 for both the parishes studied. It does not appear that Hurricane Katrina had any impact on genetic diversity, and despite the intense efforts to control mosquitoes in New Orleans, Ae. vexans has not undergone a population bottleneck.

A previous study of mtDNA variation revealed little population genetic structure among populations from British Columbia and Washington State. Here, we used samples from that study, more recent samples from 2 of the same localities, and 2 additional samples, including 1 from Japan, to investigate spatial and temporal genetic variation at 52 mapped, coding, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assayed by high-resolution melting (HRM). Little variation was detected among North American populations, which, as a group, are distinct, perhaps adaptively so, from oysters in Hiroshima, Japan. However, significant excesses of heterozygotes with respect to random mating expectations and of pairwise linkage disequilibria revealed that North American populations are not in Hardy-Weinberg (random mating) equilibrium. Moreover, genetic changes over 10 to 21 yr in 2 localities are substantial, despite high gene flow, and are as large as spatial variance per generation. These results caution against basing connectivity or seascape genetic analyses on snapshots of spatial population structure in high gene-flow species. Because migration and selection are ruled out as causes of temporal genetic change, random genetic drift is the most parsimonious explanation. This implies effective population sizes (Ne) of hundreds to a few thousands, orders of magnitude smaller than the natural abundance (N) of this oyster. These low Ne: N ratios are compatible with the hypothesis of sweepstakes reproductive success.","dhedge@usc.edu",2017,"10.3354/meps12009","MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES","temporal-genetics","KJ","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","popsize","adaptation","","marine","Bivalvia","Canada,USA","Pipestem Inlet,Dabob Bay","2010.01.01,2006.01.01,1996.01.01,1990.01.01,1985.01.01","148,92,94,22,16",912.5,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","HRM","muscle","","Qiagen DNeasy","LightCycler","HRM_assay","Pipestem inlet sampled in 2010 & 1990, Dabob bay sampled in 2006, 1996 & 1985; uses HRM (high-resolution melting) markers but can also be decomposed into SNPs?","2010.01.01","148","92","94","22","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada","USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.0065753424658,9131,25.0164383561644

Variability of 12 polymorphic microsatellite markers was analysed for 178 individuals born between 1955 and 2005, divided by birth year into five temporal groups. Low overall allelic richness (AR) per locus (AR = 2.0) and a low overall expected heterozygosity (H-E = 0.28) were observed. The overall F-IS was not significantly different from zero. The mean F-IS values were, however, significantly different from zero for individuals born between 1955 and 1965 (F-IS = 0.19). A Bayesian computation was used to estimate effective population size (N-e) for each temporal group. We observed relatively small values of N-e ranging from 7.9 to 28.4. The low N-e values confirm that, despite a rapid growth of the bison population following the founder event, N-e increased only slowly.

Together, these factors should reduce population genetic diversity and persistence probabilities. In this study, our goal was to understand genetic responses of stream fish populations to disturbance in an intermittent stream network. This network is occupied by Rio Grande sucker (Pantosteus plebeius) that is native to highland desert streams in North America. Sample localities in upland perennial reaches were connected by moderate to high levels of gene flow even when separated by up to a 30-km intermittent reach. However, drier and lower-elevation reaches were significant barriers to gene flow. Effects of genetic drift (lower allelic diversity and higher levels of inbreeding) were more pronounced in the watershed with fewest wetted reaches. Temporal analysis of genetic diversity indicated that streams with several spatially distinct wetted reaches were more genetically resistant to wildfire-induced demographic bottlenecks than a stream with only one wetted reach. Maintenance of multiple wetted reaches within streams and facilitated gene flow among watersheds could slow losses of genetic diversity in upland desert stream fishes, and will be important strategies for conserving stream biodiversity in the face of habitat fragmentation and disturbance related to climate change.","turnert@unm.edu",2015,"10.1007/s10592-014-0666-0","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","KC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","Seco,Palomas,Upper Palomas,Animas,Upper Animas","2012.01.01,2003.01.01","50.34.25.15.32,21.21.20.20.16",1095,"pre-designed","both","climate_change","natural_disaster","env_variation","acute","microsat","fin","ethanol","Phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","","2012.01.01","50.34.25.15.32","21.21.20.20.16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3.00182648401826,3287,9.00547945205479

We evaluated changes in location and composition of a hybrid zone over a 15-year period (with replicated sampling in 1997-2000 and 2011-2013) for saltmarsh (Ammodramus caudacutus) and Nelson's (A. nelsoni) sparrows, two tidal marsh specialists of high conservation priority in the northeastern United States. We combined genetic analyses using microsatellite and mitochondrial markers with species distribution patterns. In both time periods, replicate genetic sampling (n = 85; five sites) and field population surveys (93 sites) were conducted. We compared the distribution of parental species and hybrids and estimates for hybrid zone width and center between the two time periods. An increase in the relative proportion of Nelson's sparrows in sympatric marshes and an approximate doubling of hybrid zone width provides evidence for expansion. Introgression rates increased over time for neutral loci but declined for a mitochondrial gene and two gene-associated loci under the influence of selection, as expected under a speciation model with barriers to gene flow. On average, the center of the hybrid zone shifted 60 km southward over the 15 years. We placed our findings within a policy framework to evaluate management options for hybrids. We conclude that despite increasing rates of introgression, hybridization poses a substantially lesser threat to parental populations than the imminent consequences of sea-level rise and habitat degradation. Based on our current knowledge of hybrid zone dynamics in this system, we conclude that the conservation of hybrids is warranted along with parental species at this time.","jennifer.walsh.emond@gmail.com",2017,"10.1007/s10592-016-0920-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","ACS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","yes","terrestrial","Aves","USA","Lubec marsh,Weskeag marsh,Scarborough marsh,Wells marsh,Prudence Island","2012.07.01,1998.07.01","9.16.29.14.17,16.19.20.15.15",365,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","climate_change","","chronic","microsat","blood","lysis buffer (HCl/EDTA)","Yecerinac et al. 1995","Cycle","PCR","two species (hybridization study) -- Lubec marsh only Nelson's sparrow, Prudence Island only Saltmarsh sparrow, all others mixture of two; 2012 represents 2011-2012 (July both), 1998 represents 1998-1999 (July both); generation time pulled from: https://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/PDF/endangered/at-risk/Saltmarsh-Sparrow.pdf","2012.07.01","9.16.29.14.17","16.19.20.15.15",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14.0109589041096,5114,14.0109589041096

Lake Superior is the coldest and northernmost of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here, we present an extension of a long-term data set that monitors genetic and phenotypic diversity of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Superior. Hypotheses were investigated pertaining to loss of genetic diversity and genetic homogenization among three lake trout ecomorphs in Lake Superior during their recovery several decades after a major fishery collapse in the early 1960s. Comparison of a contemporary (2004-2013) microsatellite DNA data set to a previously published, post-collapse recovery period data set (1995-1999) indicated substantive losses in genetic diversity. Allelic richness decreased by 5.7%, 12.3%, and 6.8% at Isle Royale, Stannard Rock, and Klondike Reef, respectively. A 60.7% reduction in genetic distance among ecomorphs since the 1990s was detected. Comparisons with a third data set of samples collected during the fishery collapse (1959) indicated an overall 18.2% loss in allelic richness at Isle Royale. The amount of introgression among ecomorphs has likely increased over time. Apparent losses in genetic diversity could be a consequence of historical fishery harvests (early 1900s) exacerbated by intensive stocking (1950s-1980s) and invasions of non-native species (1960s-1990s). Overlap in foraging and breeding areas may have contributed to increasing levels of hybridization among ecomorphs. Knowledge of these processes will help to identify impediments and strategies for the maintenance of lake trout biodiversity in northern Great Lakes, and their re-establishment in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

In the present study, we used the mtDNA D-loop sequence to assess the temporal genetic variation in samples from six successive years for the greater long-tailed hamster, Tscherskia triton. Sampling was carried out between 1998 and 2003 in cropland on the North China Plain, China. A total of 108 individuals were analyzed. The temporal samples showed a high level of genetic diversity. Substantial genetic changes in haplotype frequencies over time were detected for the hamster population. Random genetic drift and migration are likely to be the major factors responsible for the observed temporal pattern. The genetic diversity of the hamster population was higher in years with higher population density, and lower in years with lower population density. The result supports our hypothesis that genetic diversity decreases when population density declines in animals whose population oscillates greatly between years. The combined effects of inbreeding and genetic drift caused by reproduction, dispersal and population size might play important roles in the observed changes in genetic structure and diversity between years.","zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn",2006,"10.1111/j.1749-4877.2006.00035.x","INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KJ","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","China","Raoyang County","2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01","20,13,17,20,19,19",70,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","muscle","ethanol","phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","","2003.01.01","20","13","17","20","19","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"China",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26.0857142857143,1826,5.0027397260274

Their cryptic and subterranean lifestyle makes them difficult to detect, and we know little about their colony dynamics over time. In this study we examined the persistence of Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) colonies in the city of Paris over a period of 15 years. The aim was (1) to define the boundaries of colonies sampled within the same four areas over two sampling periods, (2) to determine whether the colonies identified during the first sampling period persisted to the second sampling period, and (3) to compare the results obtained when colonies were delineated using a standard population genetic approach versus a Bayesian clustering method that combined both spatial and genetic information. Herein, colony delineations were inferred from genetic differences at nine microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial locus. Four of the 18 identified colonies did not show significant differences in their genotype distributions between the two sampling periods. While allelic richness was low, making it hard to reliably distinguish colony family type, most colonies appeared to retain the same breeding structure over time. These large and expansive colonies showed an important ability to fuse (39% were mixed-family colonies), contained hundreds of reproductives and displayed evidence of isolation-by-distance, suggesting budding dispersal. These traits, which favor colony persistence over time, present a challenge for pest control efforts, which apply treatment locally. The other colonies showed significant differences, but we cannot exclude the possibility that their genotype distributions simply changed over time.","ag.bagneres@cefe.cnrs.fr",2017,"10.1007/s10709-017-9991-9","GENETICA","temporal-genetics","KF","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","France","A1C1,A1C3,A1C4,A3C1,A3C2,A4C1","2016.01.01,2001.01.01","20.50.20.30.20.70,10.160.10.30.30.60",NA,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","invasive_species","","chronic","microsat","head,thorax","ethanol","Qiagen,Promega","Sanger","PCR","","2016.01.01","20.50.20.30.20.70","10.160.10.30.30.60",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"France",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5478,15.0082191780822

Migratory populations breed in eastern Russia and northeastern China, whereas the resident population inhabits the island of Hokkaido, Japan. Although the population inhabiting Hokkaido had experienced a severe bottleneck by the end of the 19th century, the population size has recovered to about 1500 and continues to increase now thanks to conservation efforts. A previous study reported that no marked genetic differences were seen in the island population, and that the genetic variation of the whole population on Hokkaido was lower than that of the continental population. However, the precise genetic structure of the island population in the past or near present remains unclear. To better understand the spatiotemporal changes in the genetic structure of the island population, we performed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses using stuffed specimens (years 1878-2001) and tissue or blood samples (years 1970-2014). We found three haplotypes in the island population, one of which was a novel mtDNA haplotype in 1997 and 2007 samples. In addition, there was no clear difference in the haplotype frequency through the time span. These results suggest that the low genetic variation of the island population persisted for the last hundred years. It is thus nearly impossible for the island population to recover its genetic variation in isolation. Conservation plans for this species should therefore include the promotion of genetic exchanges between the continental and island populations, such as through artificial introduction to Hokkaido.","masudary@sci.hokudai.ac.jp",2017,"10.2108/zs160194","ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE","historical-dna","KJ","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","other","Aves","Japan","Hokkaido","2012.01.01,2005.01.01,1995.01.01,1985.01.01,1928.01.01","83,117,16,9,5",1278,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","feather,blood","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","Samples grouped by decade, so took midpoint of decade (2010s all before 2014) except for last one (midpoint of 1878-1978);estimated from wikipedia","2012.01.01","83","117","16","9","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Japan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24.0070422535211,30681,84.0575342465753

The kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) is a critically endangered New Zealand parrot that was formerly widespread and abundant. It is well established that both Polynesian and European colonization of New Zealand impacted the native avifauna, but the timeframe and severity of impacts have differed depending on species. Here, we investigated the relative importance of the 2 waves of human settlement on kakapo decline, using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to characterize recent kakapo genetic and demographic history. We analyzed samples from 49 contemporary individuals and 54 museum specimens dating from 1884 to 1985. Genetic diversity decreased significantly between historical and contemporary kakapo, with a decline in mean number of microsatellite alleles from 6.15 to 3.08 and in number of mtDNA haplotypes from 17 to 3. Modeling of demographic history indicated a recent population bottleneck linked to the period of European colonization (approximately 5 generations ago) but did not support a major decline linked to Polynesian settlement.

Population genetic comparisons across time periods can help elucidate temporal changes in populations and the processes responsible for the changes. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are wide-ranging carnivores and are currently increasing in abundance across an expanding range. Bobcat populations in New England have fluctuated in the past century in response to changes in their prey base, harvest pressure, and landscape development. We genotyped contemporary (2010-2017) and historic (1952-1964) bobcats from New England and Quebec, Canada at a suite of microsatellite loci and tested for differences in diversity, effective population size, and gene flow. Over 20 generations separated the sampling periods, and the intervening years were marked by drastic changes in land use and species management regimes. We found a general decrease in genetic diversity and differing population genetic structure through time. Effective population size decreased at the end of the historic period, coincident with a spike in harvest, but rebounded to greater numbers in the contemporary period. Our results suggest that bobcat populations in the region are robust, but development and range dynamics may play a significant role in population structure. Our study also highlights the benefits of a historical perspective in interpreting contemporary population genetic data.","rorypocarroll@gmail.com",2019,"10.1007/s10592-019-01170-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","EG","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","connectivity","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","New Hampshire","2014.01.01,1958.01.01","236,59",730,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","","chronic","microsat","bone","dried","EDTA,1% SDS,10 mM DTT,1 mg/ul proteinase K","Sanger","PCR","took midpoint of sample date range for both timepoints","2014.01.01","236","59",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28.0191780821918,20454,56.0383561643836

It is possible that the evolutionary processes during the post-colonization period may increase the genetic diversity and gene flow among invasive populations over time, facilitating their long-term success. Therefore, genetic diversity and population structure would be expected to show greater temporal variation for successful introduced populations than for native populations. We studied the population genetics of the walnut husk fly, Rhagoletis completa, which was introduced into California from the Midwestern US in the early 1900s. We used microsatellites and allozymes to genotype current and historic fly populations, providing a rare perspective on temporal variability in population genetic parameters. We found that introduced populations showed greater temporal fluctuations in allele frequencies than native populations. Some introduced populations also showed an increase in genetic diversity over time, indicating multiple introductions had occurred. Population genetic structure decreased in both native and introduced populations over time. Our study demonstrates that introduced species are not at equilibrium and post-colonization processes may be important in ameliorating the loss of genetic diversity associated with biological invasions.","Yolanda.Chen@uvm.edu",2010,"10.1007/s10709-010-9491-7","GENETICA","temporal-genetics","BR","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","popsize","","","terrestrial","Insecta","USA","Hays,I-70,Junction City,Larence,Medford,Lodi,Upper Lake,San Anselmo","2002.09.01,1976.09.01,1973.09.01","50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50,50.50.50.50,50.50.50.50",365,"opportunistic","natural","invasive_species","env_variation","","chronic","microsat","whole","frozen","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","Only recording sites that are direct temporal comparisons; assume hist sample sizes are ~50 (based on original publication); all sites sampled in 2002, Hays, I-70, Junction City & Larence in 1976, others in 1973;generation time: http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7430.html","2002.09.01","50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50","50.50.50.50","50.50.50.50",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29.0191780821918,10592,29.0191780821918

By using ancient DNA techniques, it is possible to combine genetic evidence from the historical population with contemporary samples to provide a more complete picture of a species' genetic variation across its historical range and through time. Applying this approach, we examined changes in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (526 base pairs) of the endangered California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus). Results showed >80% reduction in unique haplotypes over the past 2 centuries. We found no spatial sorting of haplotypes in the historical population; the periphery of the range contained haplotypes that were common throughout the historical range. Direct examination of mtDNA from California Condor museum specimens provided a new window into historical population connectivity and genetic diversity showing: (1) a substantial loss of haplotypes, which is consistent with the hypothesis that condors were relatively abundant in the nineteenth century, but declined rapidly as a result of human-caused mortality; and (2) no evidence of historical population segregation, meaning that the available genetic data offer no cause to avoid releasing condors in unoccupied portions of their historical range.","jesse_delia@fws.gov",2016,"10.1650/CONDOR-16-35.1","CONDOR","ancient-dna","BR","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Aves","USA","California","1987.01.01,1984.01.01,1966.01.01,1950.01.01,1947.01.01,1940.01.01,1939.01.01,1936.01.01,1923.01.01,1917.01.01,1916.01.01,1908.01.01,1906.01.01,1905.01.01,1903.01.01,1902.01.01,1901.01.01,1900.01.01,1899.01.01,1898.01.01,1897.01.01,1896.01.01,1895.01.01,1894.01.01,1893.01.01,1892.01.01,1890.01.01,1889.01.01,1885.01.01,1877.01.01,1875.01.01,1866.01.01,1859.01.01,1855.01.01,1853.01.01,1840.01.01,1835.01.01,1825.01.01","12,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,5,3,4,4,3,2,4,3,5,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1",2555,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","disease","chronic","mtDNA_seq",NA,NA,"Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","generation time pulled from: https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/birds/California_condor/natural_history.html; multi-generational for contemp only --> offfspring used in place of founders 2X","1987.01.01","12","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","2","5",3,4,"4","3","2",4,3,"5","1","1",2,"2","2","1","1",1,"1","1",1,1,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23.1581213307241,59169,162.106849315069

To this end, levels of genetic diversity within the native and invasive range of a species are often compared. Most studies, however, focus solely on contemporary samples, relying heavily on the premise that the historic population structure within the native range has been maintained over time. Here, we assess this assumption by conducting a three-way comparison of the genetic diversity of native (historic and contemporary) and invasive (contemporary) smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) populations. Analyses of a total of 572 M. dolomieu samples, representing the contemporary invasive South African range, contemporary and historical native USA range (dating back to the 1930s when these fish were first introduced into South Africa), revealed that the historical native range had higher genetic diversity levels when compared to both contemporary native and invasive ranges. These results suggest that both contemporary populations experienced a recent genetic bottleneck. Furthermore, the invasive range displayed significant population structure, whereas both historical and contemporary native US populations revealed higher levels of admixture. Comparison of contemporary and historical samples showed both a historic introduction of M. dolomieu and a more recent introduction, thereby demonstrating that undocumented introductions of this species have occurred. Although multiple introductions might have contributed to the high levels of genetic diversity in the invaded range, we discuss alternative factors that may have been responsible for the elevated levels of genetic diversity and highlight the importance of incorporating historic specimens into demographic analyses.","diedericks.genevieve@gmail.com",2018,"10.1111/eva.12652","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","historical-dna","EG","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","connectivity","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","Oneida River.Hudson River (Saratoga Lake).Susquehanna River (Vestal).Susquehanna River (Oneosta).Susquehanna River (Lolliersville),Niagara River.St Lawrence River.Hudson River,Detroit River,Lake Erie.Potomac River,Auglaize River,Mosquito Creek,Allegheny River.Detroit River,Hudson River (Roundout River),Susquehanna River (Ostelic River).Shenandoah River,Cayuga Lake,Ohio River","2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,1941.01.01,1940.01.01,1938.01.01,1937.01.01,1936.01.01,1935.01.01,1931.01.01,1930.01.01","27.10.14.10.20,49.55.21,7,3.4,5,2,3.18,4,5.4,2,3",1460,"opportunistic","both","human_exploitation","env_variation","invasive_species","chronic","microsat","muscle","formalin","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","excluding SA sites bc from an introduction (originally reared/stocked in captivity)","2015.01.01","27.10.14.10.20","49.55.21","7","3.4","5","2","3.18","4","5.4","2","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21.2643835616438,31046,85.0575342465753

Population declines are often associated with loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious mutations, which can lead to a reduction in fitness and subsequently contribute to extinction. Using temporal approaches can help us understand the effects of population declines on genetic diversity in real time. Sequencing pre-decline as well as post-decline mitogenomes representing all the remaining mitochondrial diversity, we estimated the loss of genetic diversity in the critically endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus). We detected a signal of population expansion coinciding with the end of the Pleistocene last glacial maximum (LGM). Also, we found some evidence for northern and southern lineages, supporting the hypothesis that the species may have been restricted to isolated northern and southern refugia during the LGM. We observed an important loss of neutral genetic diversity associated with European settlement in New Zealand but we could not exclude a population decline associated with Polynesian settlement in New Zealand. However, we did not find evidence for fixation of deleterious mutations. We argue that despite high pre-decline genetic diversity, a rapid and range-wide decline combined with the lek mating system, and life-history traits of kakapo contributed to a rapid loss of genetic diversity following severe population declines.","nicolas.dussex@gmail.com; johanna.vonseth@nrm.se; bruce.robertson@otago.ac.nz; Love.Dalen@nrm.se",2018,"10.3390/genes9040220","GENES","historical-dna","RC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Aves","NewZealand","New Zealand","1995.01.01,1934.01.01","79,39",9125,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","invasive_species","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","chronic","mtDNA_seq","blood,skin","dried","phenol-chloroform,Qiagen","Illumina_HiSeq","PCR","1995 represents 1985-2005, 1934 represents 1884-1985, skin samples dried but don't know how blood samples were preserved","1995.01.01","79","39",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NewZealand",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.44164383561644,22280,61.041095890411

Pathogen-mediated selection is thought to act on immune genes and potentially maintain allelic variation in the face of genetic drift. The Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, is an endemic passerine that underwent a recent bottleneck in its last remaining population, resulting in a considerable reduction in genome-wide variation. We genotyped avian beta-defensin (AvBD) genes in contemporary (2000-2008) and museum samples (1876-1940) of the Seychelles warbler to investigate whether immunogenetic variation was lost through this bottleneck, and examined AvBD variation across four other Acrocephalus species with varying demographic histories. No variation was detected at four of the six AvBD loci screened in the post-bottleneck population of Seychelles warbler, but two silent nucleotide polymorphisms were identified at AvBD8 and one potentially functional amino-acid variation was observed at AvBD11. Variation in the Seychelles warbler was significantly lower than in the mainland migratory congeneric species investigated, but it similar to that found in other bottlenecked species. In addition, screening AvBD7 in 15 museum specimens of Seychelles warblers sampled prior to the bottleneck (1877-1905) revealed that this locus possessed two alleles previously, compared to the single allele in the contemporary population. Overall, the results show that little AvBD variation remains in the Seychelles warbler, probably as a result of having low AvBD diversity historically rather than the loss of variation due to drift associated with past demographic history.

We found no major changes in nucleotide diversity in either species, but we observed a drastic shift in Tajima's D between D. pseudoobscura timepoints at 1 locus associated with increased abundance of a set of related haplotypes. Our data also suggests that D. persimilis may have recently accelerated its demographic expansion. While the changes we observed were modest, this study reinforces the importance of considering potential temporal variation in genetic parameters within single populations over short evolutionary timescales.","jennifer.gredler@duke.edu",2015,"10.1093/jhered/esv027","JOURNAL OF HEREDITY","temporal-genetics","KF","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Insecta","USA","Mt.

According to population genetic theory, genetic structuring emerges at the expansion front together with decreasing genetic diversity, owing to multiple founder events. Thereupon, as the expansion proceeds and connectivity among populations is established, homogenization and a resurgence of genetic diversity are to be expected. Few studies have used a fine temporal scale combined with genetic sampling to track range expansions as they proceed in wild animal populations. As a natural experiment, the historical eradication of large terrestrial carnivores followed by their recovery and recolonization may facilitate empirical tests of these ideas. Here, using brown bear (Ursus arctos) as model species, we tested predictions from genetic theory of range expansion. Individuals from all over Finland were genotyped for every year between 1996 and 2010 using 12 validated autosomal microsatellite markers. A latitudinal shift of about 110 km was observed in the distribution and delineation of genetic clusters during this period. As the range expansion proceeded, we found, as theory predicts, that the degree of genetic structure decreased, and that both genetic variation and admixture increased. The genetic consequences of range expansions may first be detected after multiple generations, but we found major changes in genetic composition after just 1.5 generations, accompanied by population growth and increased migration. These rapid genetic changes suggest an ongoing concerted action of geographical and demographic expansion combined with substantial immigration of bears from Russia during the recovery of brown bears within the large ecosystem of northern Europe.","snorre.hagen@bioforsk.no",2015,"10.1098/rspb.2015.0092","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","historical-dna","JW","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","Finland","Northern Finland,Southern Finland","2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1997.01.01,1996.01.01","56.30,45.24,19.21,29.24,15.23,72.17,39.14,22.16,27.20,28.31,39.16,25.27,32.21,30.21,26.10",3650,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","chronic","microsat",NA,"ethanol","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","analyses done on N & S sub-populations, so reporting data that way;assigning as anthropogenic, bc previous human exploitation drove pop size down and seeing effects of that now","2010.01.01","56.30","45.24","19.21","29.24","15.23","72.17","39.14","22.16","27.20","28.31","39.16","25.27","32.21","30.21",26.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.40109589041096,5114,14.0109589041096

In this study we examined the mitochondrial control region from museum specimens of the Heath Hen (Tympanuchus cupido cupido), which went extinct in 1932. Today, the closest living relatives of the Heath Hen, the Greater (T. c. pinnatus), Attwater's (T. c. attwateri) and Lesser (T. pallidicinctus) Prairie-chicken, are declining throughout most of their range in Midwestern North America, and loss of genetic variation is a likely contributor to their decline. Here we show that 30 years prior to their extinction, Heath Hens had low levels of mitochondrial genetic variation when compared with contemporary populations of prairie-chickens. Furthermore, some current populations of Greater Prairie-chickens are isolated and losing genetic variation due to drift. We estimate that these populations will reach the low levels of genetic variation found in Heath Hens within the next 40 years. Genetic variation and fitness can be restored with translocation of individuals from other populations; however, we also show that choosing an appropriate source population for translocation can be difficult without knowledge of historic population bottlenecks and their effect on genetic structure.","jeffai@umich.edu",2006,"10.1007/s10592-005-7856-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","museum-dna","JW","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Aves","USA","Mead,Paul Olson,Buena Vista,Leola","1999.01.01,1953.01.01,1951.01.01","20.20.20.20,18.19,19.17",730,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin","dried","phenol/chloroform","Sanger","PCR","Only recording Wisconsin pops as these are direct temporal comparison;1951-1954:Mead.Paul Olson,1951:Buena Vista.Leola;generation time pulled from: Bellinger et al.

Excluding Scotland, where the haplotype composition of populations appears to be unchanged, haplotypes found in contemporary and historical marten populations elsewhere differed both temporally and geographically. While these data suggest that the contemporary Irish population is descended from a relict population that passed through an early to mid 1900s bottleneck, the historical and contemporary English and Welsh populations differ in their abundance of specific mtDNA control region haplotypes. These data appear to suggest that particular haplotypes may have been lost from England and Wales at some point in the early to mid 1900s, but further nuclear DNA work is required to determine whether this shift has occurred by rapid genetic drift in the mtDNA control region or whether relict populations have been replaced by pine martens from elsewhere. If the reported shifts in mtDNA haplotypes reflect population extirpation events, historical pine marten populations of England and Wales would appear to have become extinct in the twentieth century (in Wales after 1950 and in England after 1924). Additionally, the recent occurrence of haplotypes originating from continental Europe, and of M. americana, suggest that relict populations of England and Wales have been replaced by, or hybridised with, occasional released, escaped and/or translocated animals. The implications of these results for pine marten conservation, and particularly reintroduction, are discussed.","neilrjordan@gmail.com",2012,"10.1007/s10592-012-0365-7","CONSERVATION GENETICS","historical-dna","EG","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","UK,Ireland","England,Ireland,Scotland,Wales","2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2007.01.01,2005.07.01,2005.06.19,2004.06.24,2004.06.16,2004.04.02,2004.01.01,2003.12.14,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2000.01.01,1997.06.01,1996.01.01,1995.06.07,1995.01.01,1994.12.16,1994.07.16,1994.07.08,1994.01.01,1993.05.30,1993.05.05,1993.04.12,1993.01.08,1993.01.01,1990.01.01,1977.07.20,1975.01.01,1963.01.01,1956.08.06,1952.01.01,1950.11.21,1950.01.01,1948.05.01,1940.01.01,1931.01.01,1930.01.01,1929.09.02,1929.01.01,1927.03.01,1927.01.01,1925.01.01,1924.11.25,1920.03.14,1915.07.07,1912.08.30,1912.08.06,1912.06.06,1912.06.02,1912.05.25,1910.09.09,1902.05.13,1902.01.01,1886.01.01,1864.01.01","1,1.2,2,1,1,1,22,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1",912,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","human_exploitation","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","hair,skin,fecal,bone","dried","Qiagen,ZR Genomic DNA extraction kit","Sanger","PCR","2010.01.01:England.Scotland,1993.01.01:England.Scotland,1925.01.01:Scotland.Wales;""""""""on average 29 +/- 16 yrs separated """"""""historical"""""""" (pre 1981) from """"""""contemporary"""""""" (post 1981) samples in the same country","2011.01.01","1","1.2","2","1","1","1","22","1","1","1","8","1","1","1",1,1,"1","1","2",1,1,"1","2","1",1,"1","1","1.1","1",1,"1","1",1,1,1,1,1,2,"1",1,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1,1,"1",1,1,"1","1",1,1,"1",1,1,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"UK","Ireland","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,58.8717105263158,53691,147.098630136986

Samples derived from 27 populations (n = 206) covering the range of three recognized subspecies: L. l. migrans, L. l. ludovicianus, and L. l. excubitorides, and included locales from a putative intergrade zone between two subspecies. For L. l. migrans, samples include both those from extant populations and from museum specimens spanning approximately 130 years. For all samples we obtained 267 base pairs of mitochondrial control region sequence and identified a total of 23 distinct haplotypes. For a subset of samples representing a locale centered on the Canadian portion of an intergrade zone between migrans and excubitorides and locales on alternate sides of the intergrade, we obtained additional sequence for an intron of the nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Analyses of temporal trends in control region diversity of L. l. migrans populations indicate a diminution coincident with the decline in population numbers. Results from an Analysis of Molecular Variance on the control region data showed that a significant amount of total control region spatial variation was apportioned among the three subspecies (24.42%; P < 0.01). Further analyses indicated statistically significant differences between eastern and western populations of L l. migrans. We found no significant differences among considered populations in frequencies of six identified Gpdh alleles, although this result is preliminary because of small sample sizes. However, both the mitochondrial and intron data suggest a higher genetic diversity in the intergrade zone.

However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions reflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether new genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the expansion of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe during the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary populations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography and genetic changes associated with the range shift. Based on the analysis of mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP markers, we observe a higher level of genetic diversity in the expanding populations, apparently due to admixture of formerly isolated lineages. Using reciprocal transplant experiments for testing overwintering tolerance, as well as temperature preference and tolerance tests in the laboratory, we find that the invading spiders have possibly shifted their temperature niche. This may be a key adaptation for survival in Northern latitudes. The museum samples allow a reconstruction of the invasion's genetic history. A first, small-scale range shift started around 1930, in parallel with the onset of global warming. A more massive invasion of Northern Europe associated with genetic admixture and morphological changes occurred in later decades. We suggest that the latter range expansion into far Northern latitudes may be a consequence of the admixture that provided the genetic material for adaptations to new environmental regimes. Hence, global warming could have facilitated the initial admixture of populations and this resulted in genetic lineages with new habitat preferences.","krehenwinkel@evolbio.mpg.de",2013,"10.1111/mec.12223","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","historical-dna","KC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","connectivity","adaptation","","terrestrial","Arachnida","Uzbekistan,Iran,China,Japan,Germany,Poland,CzechRepublic,Sweden,Lithuania,Latvia,Austria,Denmark,Finland,Italy,Morocco,Turkey,Croatia,Switzerland,Spain,France,Greece,Hungary,Macedonia,Tunisia,Slovenia,Portugal,Netherlands,Lebanon,Belgium,Algeria,Syria,Romania,Bulgaria,Ukraine,Russia,Azerbaijan,Caucasus,Georgia","see paper (supp. table 1) for lat/lon","1986.01.01,1890.01.01","1966, 368",365,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","climate_change","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","leg","ethanol","5 PRIME ArchivePure DNA","Cycle","PCR","generation time: Leborgne & Pasquet (2005) Eur.

Extensive fur seal harvesting during the nineteenth century on Macquarie Island (subantarctic) resulted in extinction of the original population. Recolonization by three species has been slow and complex, characterized by the establishment of breeding groups of Antarctic and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and Arctocephalus tropicalis) and presumed nonbreeding (itinerant) male New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri). One thousand and seven pups from eight annual cohorts (1992-2003) were analysed using mitochondrial control region data (RFLP) and 10 microsatellite loci to estimate species composition and hybridization. Antarctic fur seals predominated, but hybridization occurred between all three species (17-30% of all pups). Involvement of New Zealand fur seals was unexpected as females are absent and males are not observed to hold territories during the breeding season. The proportion of hybrids in the population has fallen over time, apparently owing to substantial influxes of pure Antarctic and subantarctic individuals and non-random mating. Over 50% of New Zealand hybrids and 43% of Antarctic-subantarctic hybrids were not F-1, which indicates some degree of hybrid reproductive success, and this may be underestimated: simulations showed that hybrids become virtually undetectable by the third generation of backcrossing. While human impacts seem to have driven novel hybridization in this population, the present 'time slices' analysis suggests some biological resistance to complete homogenization.","melanie.lancaster@sci.monash.edu.au",2006,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03041.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","historical-dna","AAS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","yes","other","Mammalia","Australia","Macquarie Island","2003.01.01,2001.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1996.01.01,1995.01.01,1994.01.01,1992.01.01","162,149,141,135,125,117,104,74",3650,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","chronic","microsat","skin","DMSO,ethanol","CTAB protocol (Murray & Thompson 1980)","Sanger","PCR","bc hybridization study, not splitting into multiple rows for each species (really all species are being analyzed """"""""together"""""""");generation time estimated from: Paijmans et al.

By accessing genetic datasets through museum sampling, we are able to put current levels of genetic diversity and hybridization with congenerics into a historical context for enhanced conservation. In this study, we compared neutral genetic diversity of the now extinct Fernandina population to historical and current diversity of the Isabela population using 14 microsatellite markers. We found that current genetic diversity of the last remnant population (similar to 80-100 individuals) is far below levels 100 years ago, with only about half of the allelic diversity retained. Current genetic diversity is close to levels in the Fernandina population that went extinct by the 1970s. Bottleneck analysis did not show a strong signature of recent decline, and instead implies that this species may have consistently had low population sizes with wide fluctuations. Hybridization with congeneric woodpecker finches was found in the modern Isabela population, implying that some individuals within the few remaining breeding pairs are finding mates with woodpecker finches. Within the context of historical low population sizes and wide fluctuations, current conservation efforts may help the mangrove finch face current extinction threats and avoid the fate of the Fernandina population. However, this historically small lineage will likely continue to face challenges associated with small specialist species surrounded by a widely-distributed sister lineage producing viable hybrids.","lucinda.lawson@uc.edu",2017,"10.1007/s10592-016-0890-x","CONSERVATION GENETICS","ancient-dna","ACS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","yes","other","Aves","Ecuador","Isabela,Fernandina","2006.01.01,1906.01.01,1899.01.01","95,12,17",1825,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","invasive_species","","","chronic","microsat","skin","dried","GeneClean Ancient DNA","Sanger","PCR","Isabela: 1899 & 2006 (midpoint of sampling from 1999-2014), Fernandina: 1906; generation time pulled from: Rands et al.

We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequences of 34 pre-extermination wolves and found that they had more than twice the diversity of their modern conspecifics, implying a historic population size of several hundred thousand wolves in the western cUS and Mexico. Further, two-thirds of the haplotypes found in the historic sample are unique. Sequences from Mexican grey wolves (C. l. baileyi) and some historic grey wolves defined a unique southern clade supporting a much wider geographical mandate for the reintroduction of Mexican wolves than currently planned.

Modern and historic processes that limit population size can contribute to a loss of genetic variation that can reduce future adaptability of a species. Buff-breasted Sandpipers (Calidris subruficollis) are a Neotropical migratory shorebird that experienced rapid, large-scale declines in population numbers (population bottleneck) due to intensive market hunting at the turn of the 20th century. Market hunting ended shortly after the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918, but subsequent population losses have occurred due to continued anthropogenic disturbances throughout the species' migratory range. To assess the impact of population declines on the genetic variation of Buff-breasted Sandpipers, we surveyed two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, the control region and cytochrome b, from 209 museum specimens collected between 1874 and 1983 and 460 modern samples collected between 1993 and 2009. Measures of mtDNA variation did not change significantly among individuals sampled before and after the ban on market hunting, nor among four temporal groups (Pre-Act, Early Post-Act, Late Post-Act, and Modern; trend analysis: chi (2) = 0.171, P = 0.679). Similarly, we did not observe loss of common haplotypes, implying that there was no substantial reduction in unique matrilineal units during our 135-year study period. Using Bayesian Skyline reconstruction of temporal changes in effective population size of females (N (ef)), we concluded that N (ef) has been stable for the past century. Results of resampling suggest that diversity estimators can be imprecise and we emphasize the importance of a well-rounded analytical approach to addressing conservation genetic hypotheses. Considering all of the evidence it appears that genetic variation and N (ef) were stable despite the pressures of market hunting early in the 20th century and habitat loss and degradation in the latter half of the 20th century. Conservation efforts should continue to focus on maintaining the population size of Buff-breasted Sandpipers to avoid reaching a threshold where genetic variability is lost.","wisely@ufl.edu",2014,"10.1007/s10592-014-0611-2","CONSERVATION GENETICS","museum-dna","ACS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","other","Aves","Canada,USA,CostaRica,Ecuador,Paraguay,Uraguay,Brazil,Argentina","Americas","2001.01.01,1971.01.01,1939.01.01,1896.01.01","51,55,51,46",1642,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","climate_change","chronic","mtDNA_seq","feather,skin","dried","phenol-chloroform","Cycle","PCR","bc migrating species, just pooled all samples from all countries together; 1896 represents 1874-1919, 1939 represents 1920-1959, 1971 represents 1960-1983, 2001 represents 1993-2009; 2001 """"""""modern"""""""" samples were actually 460 individuals, but bootstrapped down to 51 to get similar sample size as historical ones; generation time pulled from: https://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/cosewic/sr_becasseau_roussatre_buffbreasted_sandpiper_1012_e.pdf","2001.01.01","51","55","51","46",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada","USA","CostaRica","Ecuador","Paraguay","Uraguay","Brazil","Argentina",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23.3562728380024,38351,105.071232876712

We demonstrate low genetic diversity in a critically endangered small mammal population. A common interpretation of this pattern would be that it is the result of a known, recent decline in this population. We test this interpretation and find it to be incorrect. Instead, by using museum voucher specimens, we show that the pattern of low genetic diversity is historical. This study demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate reference groups by which to interpret modern levels of genetic diversity in endangered species. We conclude that analysis of archival specimens may be essential in cases where genetic diversity is driving conservation management decisions because it may allow us to distinguish the effects of low genetic diversity from the process of losing diversity. We recognize that this approach can be limited due to several sampling issues: archival material may not be available, statistical power needs to be evaluated, sample sizes and sequence lengths may be suboptimal due to intrinsic difficulties associated with amplification of degraded DNA.

We used data from a spatially explicit, long-term genetic sampling effort of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE), USA, to identify the demographic processes underlying spatial and temporal patterns of genetic diversity. We conducted parentage analysis to evaluate how reproductive success and dispersal contribute to spatio-temporal patterns of genetic diversity in remnant groups of grizzly bears existing in the southwestern (SW), southeastern (SE) and east-central (EC) regions of the NCDE. A few reproductively dominant individuals and local inbreeding caused low genetic diversity in peripheral regions that may have persisted for multiple generations before eroding rapidly (approx. one generation) during population expansion. Our results highlight that individual-level genetic and reproductive dynamics play critical roles during genetic assimilation, and show that spatial patterns of genetic diversity on the leading edge of an expansion may result from historical demographic patterns that are highly ephemeral.","nmikle@usgs.gov",2016,"10.1098/rspb.2016.1467","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","historical-dna","KJ","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","EC_Glacier NP, SE_Glacier NP, SW_Glacier NP","2012.01.01,2010.01.01,2004.01.01","120.72.32,104.64.32,98.45.28",3650,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","","chronic","microsat","hair","dried",NA,NA,NA,"2012 represents 2011-2012 & 2010 represents 2009-2010; library prep/sequencing method not described either in original paper or in cited paper so leaving blank","2012.01.01","120.72.32","104.64.32","98.45.28",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.800547945205479,2922,8.00547945205479

Fish-parasite interactions will also be affected by predicted altered flow and temperature regimes, and other environmental stressors. Hence, identifying environmental and genetic factors associated with maintaining diversity at immune genes is critical for understanding species' adaptive capacity. Here, we combine genetic (MHC class II and microsatellites), parasitological and ecological data to explore the relationship between these factors in the remnant wild Rio Grande silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus) population, an endangered species found in the southwestern United States. Infections with multiple parasites on the gills were observed and there was spatio-temporal variation in parasite communities and patterns of infection among individuals. Despite its highly endangered status and chronically low genetic effective size, Rio Grande silvery minnow had high allelic diversity at MHC class II with more alleles recognized at the presumptive DAB1 locus compared to the DAB3 locus. We identified significant associations between specific parasites and MHC alleles against a backdrop of generalist parasite prevalence. We also found that individuals with higher individual neutral heterozygosity and higher amino acid divergence between MHC alleles had lower parasite abundance and diversity. Taken together, these results suggest a role for fluctuating selection imposed by spatio-temporal variation in pathogen communities and divergent allele advantage in maintenance of high MHC polymorphism. Understanding the complex interaction of habitat, pathogens and immunity in protected species will require integrated experimental, genetic and field studies.","mosborne@unm.edu",2017,"10.1111/mec.13936","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","ACS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","adaptation","","","","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","Bernalillo,Alameda,Los Padillas,Los Lunas,La Joya,San Antonio","2008.07.01,2006.07.01","30.30.14.30.30.29,30.30.13.30.30.30",365,"pre-designed","both","climate_change","disease","env_variation","chronic","microsat","fin","ethanol","Hillis et al. 1996","Sanger","PCR","generation time pulled from: https://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/download/education/conservation/wildlife-notes/aquatic/Rio-Grande-silvery-minnow.pdf","2008.07.01","30.30.14.30.30.29","30.30.13.30.30.30",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.0027397260274,731,2.0027397260274

In this study, we evaluated the level of temporal genetic variation in 16 anadromous and 2 freshwater salmon populations from the Western White Sea Basin (Russia) using samples collected between 1995 and 2008. To assess whether the genetic stability was affected by human activity, we also evaluated the effect of fishing pressure on the temporal genetic variation in this region. Results: We found that the genetic structure of salmon populations in this region was relatively stable over a period of 1.5 to 2.5 generations. However, the level of temporal variation varied among geographical regions: anadromous salmon of the Kola Peninsula exhibited a higher stability compared to that of the anadromous and freshwater salmon from the Karelian White Sea coast. This discrepancy was most likely attributed to the higher census, and therefore effective, population sizes of the populations inhabiting the rivers of the Kola Peninsula compared to salmon of the Karelian White Sea coast. Importantly, changes in the genetic diversity observed in a few anadromous populations were best explained by the increased level of fishing pressure in these populations rather than environmental variation or the negative effects of hatchery escapees. The observed population genetic patterns of isolation by distance remained consistent among earlier and more recent samples, which support the stability of the genetic structure over the period studied. Conclusions: Given the increasing level of fishing pressure in the Western White Sea Basin and the higher level of temporal variation in populations exhibiting small census and effective population sizes, further genetic monitoring in this region is recommended, particularly on populations from the Karelian rivers.","mikhail.ozerov@utu.fi",2013,"10.1186/1471-2156-14-88","BMC GENETICS","temporal-genetics","KJ","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","adaptation","","","other","Actinopterygii","Russia","Kachkovka,Ponoi,Danilovka,Sosnovka,Babya,Likhodeevka,Pulonga (Kola), Pyalitsa,Chaporna,Strelna,Chavanga,Indera,Varzuga,Nilma,Pulonga (Karelia),Pongoma,Pisto,Kamennaya","2008.01.01,2005.01.01,2001.01.01,1999.01.01,1995.01.01","66.93.43.46.41.46.76.26.49.63.41.60.51,32.56.41.39.29,41.44,37.42.43.50.55.57,38",1752,"opportunistic","both","human_exploitation","env_variation","","chronic","microsat","fin","ethanol","salt (Aljanabi & Martinez 1999); silica-based (Elphinstone et al. 2003)","Sanger","PCR","some pops considered freshwater (Pisto & Kamennaya); some data taken from Tonteri et al.

Zoological Studies 50(2): 220-229. In this study we assessed levels of genetic divergence and variability in 208 individuals of the supralittoral sandhopper Macarorchestia remyi, a species strictly associated with rotted wood stranded on sand beaches, by analyzing sequence polymorphisms in a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene coding cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI). The geographical distribution and ecology of the species are poorly known. The study includes 1 Tyrrhenian and 2 Adriatic populations sampled along the Italian peninsula plus a single individual found on Corfu Is. (Greece). The Tyrrhenian population was sampled monthly for 1 yr. Genetic data revealed a deep phylogeographic break between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic populations with no shared haplotypes. The single individual collected on Corfu Is. carried the most common haplotype found in the Tyrrhenian population. A mismatch analysis could not reject the hypothesis of a sudden demographic expansion in almost all but 2 monthly samples. When compared to previous genetic data centered on a variety of Mediterranean talitrids, our results place M. remyi among those species with profound intraspecific divergence (sandhoppers) and dissimilar from beachfleas, which generally display little population genetic structuring. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/50.2/220.pdf","laura.pavesi@uniroma1.it",2011,"","ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES","temporal-genetics","BR","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","connectivity","","","other","Malacostraca","Italy","Principina a Mare","2007.04.01,2007.03.01,2007.02.01,2007.01.01,2006.12.01,2006.11.01,2006.10.01,2006.09.01,2006.08.01,2006.07.01,2006.06.01,2006.05.01","15,15,15,15,15,15,15,14,15,15,15,14",180,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq",NA,"ethanol","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","sandhopper (lives on beaches and semi-terrestrial?); generation time pulled from: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-009-9909-3","2007.04.01","15","15","15","15","15","15","15","14","15","15","15","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Italy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.86111111111111,335,0.917808219178082

We assessed patterns of genetic diversity in D. elator that could affect extinction risk or influence management decisions. Specific objectives included: 1) document levels of genetic diversity, 2) document the degree and patterns of genetic divergence among localities, and 3) compare levels of genetic diversity between different time periods at the same locality. Portions of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA; control region, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, and cytochrome b) were sequenced and nuclear microsatellites were examined. Low mtDNA diversity was observed, which could be explained by an historical, species-wide genetic bottleneck. In contrast, microsatellites exhibited ample variation, and analyses were conducted using data from 11 loci and four populations (designated Quanah, Iowa Park, Vernon, and Harrold). Allelic diversity and heterozygosity were similar between populations and temporal samples. Estimates of effective population size (Ne) ranged from 5 to 856, depending on method and population, with Iowa Park showing consistently lower values than Quanah. All methods addressing population structure indicated that the Iowa Park population was divergent from the others, with Vernon and Harrold showing a somewhat intermediate relationship but with a closer affiliation with Quanah than Iowa Park, despite their closer proximity to Iowa Park. This pattern did not conform to isolation by distance, thus genetic drift appears to have played a greater role than gene flow in establishing genetic structure. There was much less difference between temporal samples compared to geographic samples, indicating that genetic drift has had only minimal impacts in shifting allelic frequencies over the time periods examined (17-36 years).","pfau@tarleton.edu",2019,"10.1093/jmammal/gyz090","JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY","historical-dna","EG","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","popsize","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","Iowa Park,Quanah,Quanah,Iowa Park","2007.01.01,1986.01.01,1970.01.01,1968.01.01","32,49,41,30",365,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin","ethanol, frozen","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","2007 represents 05-08, 1986 represents 85-86, 1970 represents 69-70, 1968 represents 1966-1969","2007.01.01","32","49","41","30",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39.027397260274,14245,39.027397260274

Wildfires are increasing in both frequency and intensity in many ecosystems, with climate change models predicting further escalations in fire-prone environments. Set against this background is the global decline of amphibians, with up to 40% of species facing extinction from multiple additive threats. Despite these disturbing figures, it is currently unclear how increasing fire frequency may impact the long-term persistence of frog populations. 2. Following a severe wildfire in south-eastern Australia in 2009, field surveys indicated healthy tree frog populations. However, the 2009 fire had significant impacts on genetic diversity, including increased levels of inbreeding and declines in effective population size. 3. Using stochastic population modelling under a range of fire-frequency scenarios, we demonstrate that amphibian populations in fire-prone environments may be increasingly vulnerable to extinction, particularly where rates of immigration are low. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study of amphibian population genetics before and after a major wildfire emphasizes the importance of integrating both ecological and genetic data into population models. This will help managers make more appropriate conservation decisions regarding fire management of natural environments, especially those containing threatened populations. Priorities for agencies involved in planning controlled burns should consider carefully the timing of controlled burns, along with maintaining habitat connectivity.","dominique.potvin@anu.edu.au",2017,"10.1111/1365-2664.12809","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","ancient-dna","KC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","other","Amphibia","Australia","Glenburn","2013.08.01,2012.08.01,2011.08.01,2010.08.01,2009.08.01,2008.08.01,2007.08.01","62,81,61,49,75,52,42",1095,"pre-designed","both","natural_disaster","climate_change","","acute","microsat","toe",NA,"chloroform isoamyl alcohol procedure,Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","LE; field work conducted btwn June-Oct each year;generation time estimated from other litoria spp","2013.08.01","62","81","61","49","75","52","42",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.00182648401826,2192,6.00547945205479

Single base errors were confirmed by replicate sequencing and included both double peaks and artifact substitutions at rates of similar to 3 x 10(-4) and similar to 1 x 10(-4) per base- pair, respectively, resulting in one or more errors or ambiguities in an 1100 base pair sequence in 21% of 219 samples. Most errors involved C -> T changes on the L-strand, presumably due to deamination of cytosine in the template. The error rates encountered here bias comparisons of haplotype number between historical and extant populations, such that the `loss' of artifact haplotypes present in a historical sample could be incorrectly attributed to a population decline or bottleneck. Sequencing errors due to miscoding lesions in template DNA have so far been reported only from ancient and formalin-fixed tissue, but they may also affect relatively recent museum samples, as shown here, and perhaps also non-invasive samples that typically yield low-quality DNA.","kristina.sefc@uni-graz.at",2007,"10.1007/s10592-006-9240-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","ancient-dna","KC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","terrestrial","Aves","SouthAfrica,Zimbabwe,Zambia,Malawi,Botswana","Africa","1996.01.01,1969.01.01","103,129",748,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","feather","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","modern samples from other study (Sorenson et al.

Population size estimates based on the Capwire model were 28 (95 % CI 19-38) in 2002-03 and 26 (95 % CI 13-33) in 2007-2008. The leopard population had a low level of genetic diversity (expected and observed heterozygosity = 0.43; average number of alleles per locus = 2.62), and effective population size was estimated to be low (N (e) = 7-16) by two genetic-based methods. We observed little improvement in the genetic diversity during the study period and did find an indication of allele loss compared with individuals from the mid-1990s, suggesting that the remaining population will continue to suffer loss of genetic diversity. Given the small population size and the low genetic diversity, with little expectation of replenishment of the genetic variation by natural immigration, successful expansion of available habitat and development of a second population based on captive individuals may be crucial for persistence of this leopard subspecies in the wild.","tasugi@ees.hokudai.ac.jp",2014,"10.1007/s10592-013-0558-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","museum-dna","EG","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","Russia","Southwest Primorskii Krai","2007.01.01,2002.01.01","18,23",1095,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","","chronic","microsat","fecal","frozen","GuSCN/silica method","Sanger","PCR","20-30 years between samples.

Baetis tricaudatus belongs to the Baetis rhodani species group, which is known to have cryptic species. Some investigators have found that B. tricaudatus morphospecies have cytochrome oxidase I (COI) diversity >20%. However, no investigators have examined whether this diversity is structured temporally, with some haplotypes being more common in certain years or seasons than others. We sequenced COI from 371 B. rhodani specimens. The 371 rhodani species group sequences generated fell into 2 well-supported clades, one with 38 Baetis adonis specimens and another with 333 B. tricaudatus specimens, which were the focus of our study. We examined the temporal and spatial dynamics of genetic diversity in B. tricaudatus populations from northern California using COI haplotype networks. The maximum genetic diversity among B. tricaudatus specimens was 1.7% and was found at a single site (Austin Creek). The same 2 dominant haplotypes of B. tricaudatus were consistent through years, sites, and seasons, and Phi(ST) values were correspondingly low. In 2 intensive sampling events, each with >40 individuals examined, intrapopulational divergence was 1.2 to 1.4%. This result suggests that most of the genetic diversity for this species in this system could be captured in 1 high-effort sampling event rather than in smaller, long-term monitoring events. Our results suggest that, based on the sites examined, Russian River populations of B. tricaudatus constitute a single species with no evidence of cryptic diversity.","natjst@berkeley.edu; ogrady@drosophilaevolution.com; resh@berkeley.edu",2017,"10.1086/691973","FRESHWATER SCIENCE","museum-dna","ACS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","other","Insecta","USA","Rsusian River","2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,2012.01.01","127,113,89,4",122,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","whole","ethanol","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","generation time estimated from: http://www.ephemeroptera-galactica.com/pubs/pub_b/pubbrittainj1982p119.pdf (roughly 3 generations/year)","2015.01.01","127","113","89","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8.98360655737705,1096,3.0027397260274

In this article, we explored whether Japanese elvers have temporal genetic structure and whether the population went through population expansion during the Pleistocene. In total, 273 specimens were collected from the Tanshui River estuary, northern Taiwan, in 1989-2008. The highly variable region of the mitochondrial DNA D-loop was cloned and sequenced. A genealogy was reconstructed based on the Neighbor-joining method, and results showed an unobvious yearly clade and a high level of haplotype diversity, but low mean nucleotide diversity among samples. Most of the pairwise F (ST) appeared statistically insignificant. These genetic parameters suggested a lack of temporal population structure combined with a sustainable high effective population size of Japanese eels. Negative values of Tajima's D and Fu's F (s) appeared in all samples with high significance. The mismatch distribution, skyline plot, and minimum spanning network indicated that historical population expansion of the Japanese eel could be traced back to the Pleistocene. Results of this study imply the Japanese eel has a complex life history, and the temporal structure of Japanese eels should be continually monitored in the future.","mctseng@mail.npust.edu.tw",2012,"10.1007/s10750-011-0958-z","HYDROBIOLOGIA","historical-dna","AAS","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","","other","Actinopterygii","Taiwan","Tanshui River","2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2005.01.01,2003.01.01,2000.01.01,1995.01.01,1991.02.01,1990.12.01,1989.01.01","31,32,30,30,32,29,28,30,31",2372,"pre-designed","both","human_exploitation","env_variation","climate_change","chronic","mtDNA_seq","muscle","ethanol","PUREGENE DNA purification kit","Sanger","PCR","","2008.01.01","31","32","30","30","32","29","28","30","31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Taiwan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.92537942664418,6939,19.0109589041096

While the effects of parasite life history on their population genetic structure have received some attention, the effect of host social system has remained largely unstudied. In this study, we investigated the population genetic structure of two closely related parasitic mite species (Spinturnix myoti and Spinturnix bechsteini) with very similar life histories. Their respective hosts, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) and the Bechstein's bat (Myotisbechsteinii) have social systems that differ in several substantial features, such as group size, mating system and dispersal patterns. Results: We found that the two mite species have strongly differing population genetic structures. In S. myoti we found high levels of genetic diversity and very little pairwise differentiation, whereas in S. bechsteini we observed much less diversity, strongly differentiated populations and strong temporal turnover. These differences are likely to be the result of the differences in genetic drift and dispersal opportunities afforded to the two parasites by the different social systems of their hosts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that host social system can strongly influence parasite population structure. As a result, the evolutionary potential of these two parasites with very similar life histories also differs, thereby affecting the risk and evolutionary pressure exerted by each parasite on its host.","jvschaik@orn.mpg.de",2014,"10.1186/1471-2148-14-18","BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KC","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","","terrestrial","Arachnida","Germany","Einsiedeln,Guttenberg,Gramschatz,Hochberg,Irtenberg","2007.01.01,2002.01.01","11.20.22.20.38,16.15.25.21.23",15,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat","whole","ethanol","proteinase K-phenol chloroform","Sanger","PCR","only S. bechsteini pops used in temporal analysis; lat lon coordinates provided in paper (table 2); generation time estimated from: Schaik et al.

However, our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of hybridization that erode versus promote species boundaries is incomplete. The endangered, endemic koloa maoli (or Hawaiian duck, Anas wyvilliana) is thought to be threatened with genetic extinction through ongoing hybridization with an introduced congener, the feral mallard (A. platyrhynchos). We investigated spatial and temporal variation in hybrid prevalence in populations throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, using genomic data to characterize population structure of koloa, quantify the extent of hybridization, and compare hybrid proportions over time. To accomplish this, we genotyped 3,308 double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) loci in 425 putative koloa, mallards, and hybrids from populations across the main Hawaiian Islands. We found that despite a population decline in the last century, koloa genetic diversity is high. There were few hybrids on the island of KauaModified Letter Turned Commai, home to the largest population of koloa. By contrast, we report that sampled populations outside of KauaModified Letter Turned Commai can now be characterized as hybrid swarms, in that all individuals sampled were of mixed koloa x mallard ancestry. Further, there is some evidence that these swarms are stable over time. These findings demonstrate spatial variation in the extent and consequences of interspecific hybridization, and highlight how islands or island-like systems with small population sizes may be especially prone to genetic extinction when met with a congener that is not reproductively isolated.","caitlin.wells@rams.colostate.edu",2019,"10.1111/mec.15286","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","museum-dna","JW","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","","","","yes","other","Aves","USA","Hanalei,Kii,Hamakua,Kanaha","2003.01.01,2013.01.01","126.19.7.6,29.16.56.4",1460,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","invasive_species","","","chronic","SNP","blood",NA,"Qiagen","Illumina_HiSeq","RAD","only temporal comparison was hybridization rates so not recording div stats; lat long provided in paper (supplemental material); 2003 represents 1998-2007, 2013 represents 2011-2015; generation time (for mallards) estimated from Lavretsky et al.

Unlike the island fox (Urocyon littoralis) and island subspecies of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), the island spotted skunk shows no morphological differentiation between islands and is differentiated only weakly from mainland subspecies, suggesting recent colonization. However, the islands have been isolated from each other and the mainland throughout the Quaternary Period. We used 8 microsatellite loci to investigate the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations of spotted skunks from 8 localities (the 2 islands and 6 mainland localities), representing 4 subspecies. Tissue samples were obtained from 66 fresh specimens collected from 2000 to 2002 and 142 museum specimens collected from 1906 to 1994. Allelic richness and heterozygosity in island spotted skunk populations was approximately 30% lower than that found in mainland localities or subspecies. All localities or subspecies were significantly differentiated (mean F-ST was 0.17 and 0.13 for localities and subspecies, respectively). Contrary to comparisons based on morphological data, genetic differentiation was especially strong between islands and between island and mainland localities or subspecies. Patterns of differentiation suggest that skunks colonized the Channel Islands shortly before rising sea levels separated Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands (11,500 years ago). Our results indicate that the taxonomic status of the island spotted skunk should be reconsidered and that both island populations might constitute evolutionarily significant units worthy of conservation.","floydch@uwec.edu",2011,"10.1644/09-MAMM-A-204.1","JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY","museum-dna","JW","RC","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","West coast","1980.01.01,1927.01.01","113,99",365,"opportunistic","natural","env_variation","","","chronic","microsat","skin","dried","GenElute","Sanger","PCR","only recording results from full dataset (not Santa Rosa Island bc subset of full dataset and showed same pattern); 1980 represents 1961-2000, 1927 represnts 1906-1949; generation time (age of first breeding) estimated from: https://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/eastern-spotted-skunk","1980.01.01","113","99",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,53.0356164383562,19358,53.0356164383562

To assess the impact of this intensive local harvest we compared historic and contemporary samples. We explored 2 models of repopulation for this region. In the recovery model animals not hunted by Peary were the source of the current population. In the recolonization model animals from adjacent regions contributed to the current population. A genetic assessment of mitochondria] DNA (mtDNA) diversity comparing historic specimens (n = 12) to contemporary samples from the same region (n = 22) indicates the loss of I major mtDNA haplogroup. In this region historic and contemporary samples were significantly differentiated from one another. Combined mtDNA (n = 121) and 9 nuclear DNA loci (n = 151) indicate that the contemporary NE animals are most similar to those in adjacent regions to the south. We interpret this as supporting our recolonization model and suggest that, following Peary, animals dispersed north from central Ellesmere. Animals from the region to the west (NW) of NE showed the greatest differentiation from all other regions, suggesting that although proximate in distance, movement between the NW and NE might always have been limited. The NW region was unique in that it contained 1 predominant mtDNA haplotype at high frequency (0.88), the lowest observed heterozygosity (H(o) = 0.50), and the highest mean relatedness (R = 0.063). Our combined results highlight the sensitivity of populations at the range limit to stochastic events and the potential limits to recovery following significant perturbations.

However, little is known about changes in genetic structure within and between parental species and hybrids over time. Here, we studied processes of genetic change in parental species and hybrids from the Daphnia longispina complex (Crustacea, Cladocera) over a period of six years across ten habitats. These cyclical parthenogens respond to fluctuating environments by switching from asexual to sexual reproduction. Importantly, sexually produced diapausing eggs, which resist extreme conditions such as low temperatures and serve as dispersal stages, are produced to a lower extent by hybrids. Long-term microsatellite data revealed clear differences between hybrids and parental species. In hybrids, clonal diversity values were lower, whereas heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium values were higher compared to parental species. Clonal diversity of hybrids responded to the strength of the winter, with cold winters resulting in few genotypes in the following spring. In time windows when only asexual hybrid females survive, priority effects will favour the establishment of the hybrid offspring before hatchlings from parental diapause eggs can enter the community. The constant high levels of heterozygosity maintained by clonal reproduction in hybrids might lead to their successful establishment over time, when they are able to escape competition from both parental species. Although we found evidence that hybrids diversity depends on fluctuating environments, a direct link between hybrid abundance and the strength of winter was missing. Because of reduced adaptability in clonally reproducing hybrids, multiple factors must contribute to promoting their long-term success in fluctuating environments.","griebel@igb-berlin.de",2016,"10.1111/jeb.12828","JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KC","KF","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","connectivity","","","yes","freshwater","Branchiopoda","Germany","Fasaneriesee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Waldschwaigsee, Fasaneriesee.FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Lusssee.OlchingerSee.Waldschwaigsee, BohmerWeiher.Fasaneriesee.FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Lusssee.OlchingerSee.Waldschwaigsee, FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.Waldschwaigsee, FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.Waldschwaigsee, BohmerWeiher.Fasaneriesee.FeldmochingerSee.Feringasee.HeimstettnerSee.LangwiederSee.LerchenauerSee.Lusssee.OlchingerSee.Waldschwaigsee","2013.04.01, 2012.04.01, 2011.04.01, 2010.06.01, 2009.05.01, 2008.07.01","40.69.72.81.49.51, 74.54.72.70.77.92.80.82.80, 16.93.92.90.94.88.92.50.92.88, 188.84.88, 171.86.87, 91.89.168.74.91.92.87.93.47.171",5,"pre-designed","natural","env_variation","","","acute","microsat",NA,NA,"Brede_etal_2006, Yin_etal_2010",NA,"PCR","Table with sample sizes does not define abbreviations, so I added N1+N2 for all species/hybrids to get sample size for each site/year (methods mention they sampled at 2 sites in each pond), generation time from https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Dappu1/Dappu1.home.html, no info in paper on extraction/preservation/tissue sampled but this is not needed anyways as these are not historical samples","2013.04.01","40.69.72.81.49.51"," 74.54.72.70.77.92.80.82.80"," 16.93.92.90.94.88.92.50.92.88"," 188.84.88"," 171.86.87"," 91.89.168.74.91.92.87.93.47.171",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,347,1735,4.75342465753425

We leveraged a natural experiment to investigate evidence of inbreeding depression and genetic rescue in a remnant population of subalpine-specialized Sierra Nevada red foxes (Vulpes vulpes necator) using noninvasive genetic monitoring during 2010-2017. Only 7 individuals were detected in the first 2 years. These individuals assigned genetically to the historical population and exhibited genetic hallmarks of inbreeding and no evidence of reproduction. Two years into the study, we detected 2 first-generation immigrant males from a recently expanding population of red foxes in the Great Basin Desert. Through annual resampling of individuals (634 red fox DNA samples, 41 individuals) and molecular reconstruction of pedigrees, we documented 1-3 litters/year for 5 years, all descended directly or indirectly from matings involving immigrant foxes. The observed heterozygosity and allelic richness of the population nearly doubled in 2 years. Abundance increased, indicative of a rapidly expanding population. Throughout the study, adult survival was high. Restoration of gene flow apparently improved the demographic trajectory of this population in the short term. Whether these benefits continue in the longer term could depend on numerous factors, such as maintenance of any locally adapted alleles. This study highlights the value of noninvasive genetic monitoring to assess rapidly shifting conditions in small populations. Uncertainties about the longer-term trajectory of this population underscore the need to continue monitoring and to research potential for both negative and positive aspects of continued genetic infusion.","cbquinn@ucdavis.edu",2019,"10.1093/jhered/esz024","JOURNAL OF HEREDITY","historical-dna","JW","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","connectivity","diversity","adaptation","yes","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA","Nevada","2017.01.01,2016.01.01,2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,2012.01.01,2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1997.01.01,1996.01.01,1941.01.01,1934.01.01,1928.01.01,1924.01.01,1923.01.01,1922.01.01,1919.01.01,1911.01.01,1896.01.01,1893.01.01,1891.01.01,1887.01.01,1858.01.01","6,10,21,6,28,5,7,6,5,28,15,16,12,12,7,8,8,2,1,2,4,1,1,1,1,1,5,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1",639,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","invasive_species","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","mtDNA (cytb + dloop).

We sampled a total of 351 individuals, genotyped them at 13 microsatellite loci and sequenced their mitochondrial D-loop to estimate genetic diversity, population structure, demographic history and effective population sizes. At the microsatellite loci, genetic diversity was high in all populations. Yet, genetic diversity was relatively low for the sequence data. Microsatellites yielded mean N-e estimates of 481 individuals (+/- 99 SD) for M.benetos and between 597 (+/- 106.3 SD) and 1524 (+/- 483.9 SD) individuals for local populations of M.zebra. The microsatellite data indicated no deviations from mutation-drift equilibrium. Maylandia zebra was further found to be in migration-drift equilibrium. Temporal fluctuations in allele frequencies were limited across the sampling period for both species. Bayesian Skyline analyses suggested a recent expansion of M.zebra populations in line with lake-level fluctuations, whereas the demographic history of M.benetos could only be estimated for the very recent past. Divergence time estimates placed the origin of M.benetos within the last 100ka after the refilling of the lake and suggested that it split off the sympatric M.zebra population. Overall, our data indicate that micro-endemics and populations in less favourable habitats have smaller N-e, indicating that drift may play an important role driving their divergence. Yet, despite small population sizes, high genetic variation can be maintained.","martinhusemann@yahoo.de",2015,"10.1111/mec.13205","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","EG","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","connectivity","diversity","","no","freshwater","Actinopterygii","Malawi","Lake_Malawi(Illala_Gap,Harbour_Island,Mazinzi_Reef)","2012.01.01,2010.01.01,1996.01.01","27,29,30",438,"pre-designed","natural","","","","","microsat","skin","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","check data of hSamples","2012.01.01","27","29","30",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Malawi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,13.3424657534247,5844,16.0109589041096

This study aims testing both, the temporal stability of the genetic diversity among samples from the Southern stock of European hake and the influence of a high fishing intensity on its Ne. Such goals were addressed with variation of microsatellites and Cytochrome b haplotypes on an 82 sample collection taken in years of deep population depletion (2000-2007) plus a historical anchoring sample from 1976 which predates the industrial exploitation of this fishery. Despite the Southern stock exhibits similar levels of variation at microsatellites and Cytochrome b across the historical window addressed, Ne experienced a 43-fold reduction in parallel to an 80% biomass (N-ssb) loss between the historical estimates of 1976 (N-ssb =20.55*10(6) Mi, N-e = 12,480) and their minimums of 2004 (N-ssb = 4.68*10(6) Mi, N-e = 291). Neither Ne nor N-e/N-ssb matched SSB trends at overharvest in 2000-2007, when a faster Ne reduction was patent. Nevertheless, Ne correlated well with SSB and the N-e/N-ssb ratio was maximal at population equilibrium and minimal at population depletion. Current results suggest that the short-term unpredictability of Ne on population trends following overexploitation can be circumvented by increasing the number of point estimates from pre-harvest and postharvest times. We show that the Southern stock has passed through a genetic throat of N-e approximate to 300 between 2002 and 2005 upon which biomass rebounded to 1/3 in 2007 and to1/2 in 2014 of its N-e size from equilibrium in 1976. Such recovery was likely helped by EU policies enforced to make this fishery sustainable, but collateral enhancers such as maintenance of a minimum Ne threshold and the enriching input of occasional gene flow from the Northern stock of hake, have presumably played a synergic role at triggering overfishing resilience. Incorporating both, structural genetics and genetic metrics such as Ne into assessment can provide more precision on the rate of genetic erosion and improving assessing risks of extinction by genetic factors.

In 1970-1980, an epizootic outbreak of mange caused a severe population decline on Mednyi Island. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a primary role in infectious disease resistance. The main objectives of our study were to compare contemporary variation of MHC class II in mainland and island Arctic foxes, and to document the effects of the isolation and the recent bottleneck on MHC polymorphism by analyzing samples from historical and contemporary Arctic foxes. In 184 individuals, we found 25 unique MHC class II DRB and DQB alleles, and identified evidence of balancing selection maintaining allelic lineages over time at both loci. Twenty different MHC alleles were observed in mainland foxes and eight in Bering Island foxes. The historical Mednyi population contained five alleles and all contemporary individuals were monomorphic at both DRB and DQB. Our data indicate that despite positive and diversifying selection leading to elevated rates of amino acid replacement in functionally important antigen-binding sites, below a certain population size, balancing selection may not be strong enough to maintain genetic diversity in functionally important genes. This may have important fitness consequences and might explain the high pathogen susceptibility in some island populations. This is the first study that compares MHC diversity before and after a bottleneck in a wild canid population using DNA from museum samples.","ploshnitsa@gmail.com",2012,"10.1002/ece3.42","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","historical-dna","KF","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","adaptation","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Russia","Bering Island.Mednyi Island","2003.01.01,1929.01.01","44.41,9.43",1460,"opportunistic","natural","disease","human_exploitation","","chronic","nuclear_seq","bone","dried","Phenol/chloroform + Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","sampling dates are pooled in study - I used midpoint for histrocial (1911-1946) and contemporary ranges (1997-2009); source for generation time: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108534","2003.01.01","44.41","9.43",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Russia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18.5123287671233,27028,74.0493150684931

Alternatively, historical samples can provide insights into changes in genetic diversity and effective population size (N-e). Kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) are a species of conservation concern across much of their range. In western Utah, kit fox abundance has declined precipitously from historical levels, causing concern about population persistence. We analyzed genetic samples from museum specimens and contemporary scats to evaluate temporal changes in (a) genetic diversity and (b) N-e for kit foxes in western Utah, and (c) discuss our findings with respect to population risk and conservation. The N-e of kit foxes in western Utah has decreased substantially. When compared to established conservation thresholds for N-e (e.g., the 50/500 rule), observed levels suggest the population may be at risk of inbreeding depression and local extinction. In contrast, we found no significant decrease in genetic diversity associated with declining N-e. We detected evidence of low levels of immigration into the population and suspect genetic diversity may have been maintained by this previously undescribed gene flow from adjacent populations. Low or intermittent immigration may serve to temper the potential short-term negative consequences of low N-e.

In this study, we used both historical and contemporary samples to assess genetic diversity and structure in this endangered Hawaiian honeycreeper. We generated sequence data from two mtDNA regions (ND2, control region) and two nuclear introns for contemporary samples representing three of the five current populations. We also generated control region sequence data for museum specimens collected over 100 years ago from throughout the historical range of the bird. Results indicate that despite recent declines and fragmentation, genetic diversity has not been lost. We detected a modest level of genetic differentiation, which followed a combined pattern of isolation-by-barriers and isolation-by-distance, across the historical range of Akepa. The similarly low level of differentiation observed between the contemporary populations indicates that not much divergence, if any, has occurred post-fragmentation. Rather, the present structure seen likely reflects the historical pattern of distribution. Ironically, this declining species exhibits the genetic signal of an expanding population, demonstrating that earlier demographic events are outweighing the effects of recent changes in population size, and genetic estimates of Ne, though crude, suggest Hawaii Akepa were at least an order of magnitude more abundant prior to the decline.","reding@iastate.edu",2010,"10.1007/s10592-009-0025-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","ancient-dna","AAS","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Aves","USA","Hawaii","2006.01.01,2002.01.01,2000.01.01,1995.01.01,1988.01.01,1903.01.01,1902.01.01,1901.01.01,1900.01.01,1899.01.01,1898.01.01,1896.01.01,1895.01.01,1894.01.01,1892.01.01,1891.01.01,1888.01.01","15,24,4,1,3,1,5,1,3,1,5,2,1,2,6,15,2",1095,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","disease","habitat_loss","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin","dried","Phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","Also nuclear seqs but only for contemporary individuals.

For species that have specific habitat requirements, habitat loss can result in substantial genetic effects, potentially impeding future adaptability and evolution. The endangered black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) suffered a substantial contraction of breeding habitat and population size during much of the 20th century. In a previous study, we reported significant differentiation between remnant populations, but failed to recover a strong genetic signal of bottlenecks. In this study, we used a combination of historical and contemporary sampling from Oklahoma and Texas to (i) determine whether population structure and genetic diversity have changed over time and (ii) evaluate alternate demographic hypotheses using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We found lower genetic diversity and increased differentiation in contemporary samples compared to historical samples, indicating nontrivial impacts of fragmentation. ABC analysis suggests a bottleneck having occurred in the early part of the 20th century, resulting in a magnitude decline in effective population size. Genetic monitoring with temporally spaced samples, such as used in this study, can be highly informative for assessing the genetic impacts of anthropogenic fragmentation on threatened or endangered species, as well as revealing the dynamics of small populations over time.","giri.athrey@tamu.edu",2012,"10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00233.x","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","historical-dna","AAS","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Aves","USA","Texas, Oklahoma","2008.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,1915.01.01,1910.01.01,1908.01.01,1900.01.01","25,34,50,20,15,17,8",547.5,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","invasive_species","","chronic","microsat","skin","dried","QiaAmp","Sanger","PCR","3 sites","2008.01.01","25","34","50","20","15","17","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,72.0474885844749,39446,108.071232876712

Genetic techniques may help to distinguish populations that are self-sustaining from those at risk of further decline, and demographic interdependence among subpopulations. We tested the use of genetic data for identifying stable and self-sustaining abalone populations, as well as the efficacy of a restoration technique for use in those populations that are not. We created an artificial aggregation of wild adult pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata) in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA. We genetically analyzed those individuals and additional adults and juveniles in the broader region. A self-sustained population should not be demographically reliant upon immigration. Temporal variability in relatedness among juvenile cohorts, and a lack of fine-scale spatial structure in adult and juvenile relatedness indicated complex recruitment dynamics and/or long distance larval delivery. We estimated a low effective population size (N-e = 188) and a very low ratio of effective population to census population size (N-e/N = 2.0 x 10(-3)). These data are consistent with sweepstakes reproductive success, and suggest that the population is at risk of genetic diversity decline. Parentage assignment revealed that none of the juveniles sampled one year after aggregating adults had parents from this aggregation. Collectively, our results suggest that restoration efforts will need to achieve a greater density (0.18 m(-2)) and/or number of individuals (46) to improve local recruitment. Our results also suggest that the Point Loma kelp forest population of pink abalone is of insufficient density for long-term viability, may be reliant upon immigration, and cannot be defined as an independent """"""""""""""""local"""""""""""""""" population unit.

Population genetics provide a genuine alternative to estimate population size and inbreeding using non-lethal procedures. The long-snouted seahorse, Hippocampus guttulatus, is facing multiple threats such as human disturbance or by-catch, and has been listed in the red list of IUCN. One large population is found in the Thau lagoon, in the south of France. A recent study has shown this population belongs to a genetic lineage only found in Mediterranean lagoons that can be considered as an Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) and should be managed with dedicated conservation strategies. In the present study, we used genetic analysis of temporal samples to estimate the effective population size of the Thau population and correlations between individual multilocus heterozygosity and fitness traits to investigate the possible expression of inbreeding depression in the wild. Non-invasive sampling of 172 seahorses for which profiles were pictured and biometric data recorded were genotyped using 291 informative SNPs. Genetic diversity remained stable over a 7-year time interval. In addition, very low levels of close relatedness and inbreeding were observed, with only a single pair of related individuals in 2008 and two inbreds in 2013. We did not detect departure from identity equilibrium. The effective population size was estimated to be N-e = 2742 ( 40 reproductive seahorses per km(2)), larger than previously thought. No correlation was observed between heterozygosity and fluctuating asymmetry or other morphometric traits, suggesting a population with low variance in inbreeding. Together these results suggest this population does not meet conventional genetic criteria of an endangered population, as the population seems sufficiently large to avoid inbreeding and its detrimental effects. This study paves the way for the genetic monitoring of this recently discovered ESU of a species with patrimonial and conservation concerns.","flo.riquet@gmail.com; cathy.haag@haagliautard.net; lucy.woodall@zoo.ox.ac.uk; Julien.Claude@univ-montp2.fr; patrick.louisy@wanadoo.fr; nicolas.bierne@umontpellier.fr",2019,"10.1007/s10592-019-01210-3","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","EG","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","marine","Actinopterygii","France","Thau Lagoon","2013.01.01,2008.01.01,2006.01.01","49,110,13",730,"pre-designed","natural","","","","chronic","SNP","skin","ethanol","cetyltrimethylammonium bromide chloroform:isoamyl alcohol","Illumina_HiSeq","PCR","generation time is unknown, they chose 2 years but also used 3 and 5 year times; basically testing for inbreeding, note that they are endangered but no test of driver/disturbance in the study; fin clip used I just put skin; ","2013.01.01","49","110","13",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"France",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3.5027397260274,2557,7.00547945205479

Previous studies have quantified the recent decline of numerous Lepidopteran species in the U.K., including the garden tiger moth (Arctia caja), in C which abundance has decreased by 85% over the past 30 years. At the same time that overall numbers have been falling, the distribution of abundance of this species has been moving northwards. In this study, morphological and genetic data were used to C, investigate the possibility that these changes in abundance and distribution have been accompanied by microevolutionary changes. 2. A comparison of wing size and shape in current and historical moth samples revealed that wing shape has altered significantly over the past century, resulting in longer, narrower hindwings and narrower forewings for a given forewing length. Habitat fragmentation and increased suitability of northerly sites provide a plausible explanation for the selection of increasingly dispersive individuals. 3. Mitochondrial DNA revealed no phylogeographic structuring either before or after the population decline. However, a comparison of mtDNA haplotypes from current and museum specimens indicated that the recent population decline across the U.K. has been accompanied by a significant loss of genetic diversity. 4. The changes in wing shape suggest recent adaptation to environmental change, whereas a loss of genetic diversity may limit the ability of garden tiger moths to adapt to future environmental change.","joannafreelan@trentu.ca",2008,"10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01013.x","ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY","historical-dna","EG","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","diversity","popsize","","","no","terrestrial","Insecta","UK","","","",28,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","muscle","dried","Nucleospin Tissue Kit","Sanger","PCR","This paper should be in the diversity section, no analysis of population size metrics; tissue type was an entire leg; generation time source: 10.1371/journal.pone.0152787",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UK",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Samples obtained from 1892 to 2003 were subdivided into historical (prior to 1970) and recent (from 1970) groups. As compared with the historical samples, there was a significant loss of genetic variation in the recent Jutland population, but not in Sealand. Effective population sizes were estimated using Bayesian-based software (TMVP). Historical effective population sizes were 5897 (90% highest probability density, HPD, limits: 1502-6849) in Jutland and 1300 (90% HPD limits: 224-5929) in Sealand, whereas recent effective population sizes were 14.7 (90% HPD limits: 10.9-23.5) in Jutland and 802 (90% HPD limits: 51.8-5510) in Sealand. Significant genetic differentiation (F-ST) was found between the two historical samples, between the two recent samples, and between the historical and the recent sample in Jutland; whereas the F-ST value between the historical and the recent sample in Sealand was not significant. The significant genetic differentiation between the historical and the recent samples indicates changes in the genetic compositions over time, and the higher F-ST values between the two recent samples, as compared with the two historical samples, indicates that the populations in Sealand and Jutland have drifted apart within a short time span. No deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found within populations, indicating no further substructuring.

Our goals were to evaluate how genetic metrics responded to changes in wild fish density and whether they corresponded to the number and levels of diversity of hatchery-reared repatriates. Genetic diversity and all measures of Ne in the wild population did not correlate with wild fish density until hatchery supplementation began in earnest. Estimates of variance and inbreeding effective size were not correlated. Our results suggest sourcesink dynamics where captive stocks form a genetically diverse source and the wild population behaves as a sink. Nevertheless, overall genetic diversity of silvery minnow has been maintained over the last decade, and we attribute this to a well-designed and executed propagation management plan.

Violations of these assumptions may impact population-level parameter estimation and lead to spurious inferences. Here, we used targeted capture to sequence the full mitochondrial genome from 123 individuals of the Galapagos giant tortoise endemic to Pinzon Island (Chelonoidis duncanensis) sampled at 2 time points pre- and postbottleneck (circa 1906 and 2014) to explicitly assess differences in diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions based on subsets of the mitochondria! genome versus the full sequences and to evaluate potential biases associated with diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions from postbottlenecked samples alone. Haplotypic diversities were equal between the temporal samples based on the full mitochondrial genome, but single gene estimates suggested either decreases or increases in diversity depending upon the region. Demographic reconstructions based on the full sequence were more similar between the temporal samples than those based on the control region alone, or a subset of 3 regions, where the trends in population size changes shifted in magnitude and direction between the temporal samples. In all cases, the estimated coalescent point was more distant for the historical than contemporary sample.

Subsequently, the population has been monitored by radio-tracking and collecting data on bear signs and observations. In 2000 we started a genetic monitoring program of the population with the aim to obtain data on population size, sex ratio, relationships as well as movements of individuals. We present results from six years of genetic monitoring, which were combined with field observations. During this time 1,005 hair and faecal samples were gathered in an area of[ 3,000 km(2), most of them in the core area of <1,000 km(2). Furthermore we analysed blood samples from captured individuals. Eight microsatellite and two sex determination loci were employed for DNA profiling. The number of detected individuals is surprisingly low, ranging from 5-8 per year. Concerning relationships the analysis reveals that all genotyped individuals are descendants of the founder individuals indicating that no immigration took place. Only one male and three females (mother and 2 daughters) took part in reproduction. Considering the fact that 28 bears were born in this region since 1991 the question arises where the bears disappear to. Our results suggest that subadult bears migrate from the core area. However, indices of bear occurrence outside the core area are rare and migration could be proved only for two young males.

Thus, it is important to monitor not only the number of individuals in a population, but also how they are associated in groups and how those groups are distributed across the landscape. Adding to the challenge of obtaining such information with high precision for endangered and elusive species is the need for long-term collection of such data. In this study we compare sampling approaches and genotype non-invasive genetic samples to estimate the number and distribution of wild western lowland gorillas occupying a 100 km(2) area in Loango National Park, Gabon, for the periods 2005-2007 and 2014-2017. Based on the number of genotyped individuals we inferred a minimum of 83 gorillas during the first and 81 gorillas during the second study period. We also obtained similar capture-recapture population size estimates for the two periods despite variance in social dynamics like group formations, group dissolutions and individual dispersal. We furthermore found area fidelity for two groups that were sampled for 10-12 years, despite variation in group membership. Our results revealed how individual movements link groups in a 'network' and show that western lowland gorilla populations can show a high degree of temporal and geographic stability concurrent with substantial social dynamics.","laura_hagemann@eva.mpg.de",2019,"10.1007/s10592-019-01209-w","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","ACS","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Gabon","Loango National Park","","",8030,"pre-designed","natural","","","","acute","microsat","hair","dried","EURx Gene Matrix Stool DNA kit version 1.2","Sanger","PCR","really unclear sampling scheme; DNA sample was feces; Generation time source IUCN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gabon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It appears that this species began to invade the mainland from the Florida Keys or Cuba by the 1930s, hybridizing with J. coenia and bringing with it mitochondrial haplotype group A, which is common in the Caribbean but is essentially absent from North American Junonia. By the 1940s, J. zonalis appears to have established populations in Miami, but eventually may have been extirpated. Later, new populations of J. zonalis may have become established on mainland Florida by subsequent waves of J. zonalis migrants. Substantial fluctuations in both population size and mitochondrial haplotype group A frequency seem to be characteristic of Florida mainland populations of J. zonalis. Populations of J. zonalis in the Florida Keys and Cuba have maintained nearly constant mitochondrial haplotype group A frequencies over many decades and may be more stable than those on the Florida mainland. Junonia zonalis specimens attributed to Chokoloskee, Florida, from the early 1900s have questionable provenance. Based on their haplotype frequency and other evidence these Chokoloskee specimens may have been collected in Cuba.

We found no significant changes in the allele frequencies for the Moray Firth population, while subtle but significant genetic changes over time were detected for the Bornholm Basin population. Estimates of the effective population size (N-e) generally exceeded 500 for both populations when employing a number of varieties of the temporal genetic method. However, confidence intervals were very wide and N-e's most likely range in the thousands. There was no apparent loss of genetic variability and no evidence of a genetic bottleneck for either of the populations. Calculations of the expected levels of genetic variability under different scenarios of N-e showed that the number of alleles commonly reported at microsatellite loci in Atlantic cod is best explained by N-e's exceeding thousand. Recent fishery-induced bottlenecks can, however, not be ruled out as an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between high levels of variability and recently reported estimates of N-e << 1000. From life history traits and estimates of survival rates in the wild, we evaluate the compatibility of the species' biology and extremely low N-e/N ratios. Our data suggest that very small N-e's are not likely to be of general concern for cod populations and, accordingly, most populations do not face any severe threat of losing evolutionary potential due to genetic drift.","nap@dfu.min.dk",2006,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02777.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","historical-dna","KC","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","marine","Actinopterygii","Denmark,Scotland","Moray Firth, Bornholm Basin, Moray Firth, Bornholm Basin","2002.01.01,1997.01.01,1965.01.01,1928.01.01","71,62,50,50",1522.05,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","env_variation","","chronic","microsat","bone","dried","Pro K/Chelex procedure (Estoup et al. 1996)","Sanger","PCR","tissue type was sagital otolith (inner ear)","2002.01.01","71","62","50","50",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Denmark","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17.7582865214678,27029,74.0520547945205

Using temporally-spaced samples of microsatellite DNA, we tested several genetic hypotheses that might explain an unsuccessful attempt to re-establish Atlantic salmon populations (Salmo salar) in two rivers of the inner Bay of Fundy, Canada. Census sizes (N) in both populations plummeted to near zero from initial increases after reintroduction/human-mediated recolonization occurred. Over the same period (1974-1996), both populations were characterized by low or relatively low effective sizes (N (e) ) and temporally unstable genetic structuring, whereas neighbouring populations, known historically for their significant salmon production, were not. Despite evidence for genetic bottlenecking and continual linkage disequilibrium over time in both populations, neither exhibited detectable inbreeding or a significant loss of allelic diversity or heterozygosity relative to known donor/source populations. Ratios of N (e) to N also increased with decreasing N in both populations, implying a buffering capacity against losses of genetic diversity at depressed abundances. Most significantly, multiple lines of evidence were consistent with the hypothesis that there has been substantial and recurrent asymmetric migration (migration rate, m) from neighbouring areas into both populations even after initial rehabilitation. This included migration from a historically productive population that became extirpated during the course of rehabilitation efforts, indicating that both populations might have naturally depended on immigration from neighbouring areas for persistence. Our results highlight the value of incorporating temporal genetic data beyond commonly used metrics of neutral genetic diversity (F-ST, allelic richness, heterozygosity) to evaluate rehabilitation successes or failures. They also illustrate how the joint evaluation of multiple genetic concerns in rehabilitation attempts, at spatial scales beyond donor and rehabilitated populations, is useful for focusing future rehabilitation efforts.","dylan.fraser@dal.ca",2007,"10.1007/s10592-006-9188-8","CONSERVATION GENETICS","historical-dna","KC","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","freshwater","Actinopterygii","Canada","New Brunswick","","",1350.5,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","","","acute","microsat","scale","dried","Custom but similar to Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","sampling scheme in table 1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, it is necessary to know which factors most strongly impact Ne, and how to mitigate these effects through sound management actions. In this study, we use parentage analysis of a stream-living brown trout (Salmo trutta) population to quantify the effect of between-individual variance in reproductive success on the effective number of breeders (Nb) relative to the census number of breeders (Ni). Comprehensive estimates of the Nb/N ratio were reduced to 0.160.28, almost entirely due to larger than binomial variance in family size. We used computer simulations, based on empirical estimates of age-specific survival and fecundity rates, to assess the effect of repeat spawning (iteroparity) on Ne and found that the variance in lifetime reproductive success was substantially higher for repeat spawners. Random family-specific survival, on the other hand, acts to buffer these effects. We discuss the implications of these findings for the management of small populations, where maintaining high and stable levels of Ne is crucial to extenuate inbreeding and protect genetic variability.","d.r.serbezov@bio.uio.no",2012,"10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00239.x","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","KC","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","freshwater","Actinopterygii","Norway","Bellbekken","","",2263,"pre-designed","natural","","","","acute","microsat","muscle","ethanol","Salt-based method outlined in Aljanabi & Martinez (1997)","Sanger","PCR","Complicated sampling scheme with parents from unkown years (2002-2005) but defined cohort sampling 2003-2005, even though all were used in analyses; No real driver/disturbance testing in the study",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Norway",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For endemic island species in particular, current genetic impoverishment could be due to either a recent population crash or a consequence of an evolutionary history of sustained isolation and small effective population size. Interpreting any given case can often be further complicated by incomplete or contradictory evidence from historical field surveys that might suggest a very different demographic history. Here, we use the case of the Seychelles kestrel (Falco araea), an island endemic previously listed as critically-endangered but now relatively common, to illustrate how genetic data from microsatellite genotypes of 100-150-year-old museum specimens reveals a recent and severe population crash since the 1940s to approximately eight individuals, before the population recovered. We re-interpret the historical population trajectory of the Seychelles kestrel in the light of the minimal intervention required for this species to recover. We examine different ecological explanations for the decline and apparently unassisted recovery of the Seychelles kestrel, review the evidence for similarly unaided recoveries elsewhere and discuss the implications of unaided population recoveries for future species conservation programmes.

However, these techniques may be influenced by recent population bottlenecks, which have the potential to eliminate lineages that reveal past changes in demography. One way to examine the performance of these demographic methods is to compare samples from populations before and after recent bottlenecks. We compared estimates of demographic history from populations of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) before and after recent bottlenecks using four common methods (nested clade analysis [NCA], Tajima's D, mismatch distribution, and MDIV). We found that NCA did not perform well in the presence of bottleneck events, although it did recover some genetic signals associated with increased isolation and the extinction of intermediate populations. The majority of estimates for Tajima's D, including those from bottlenecked populations, were not significantly different from zero, suggesting our data conformed to neutral expectations. In contrast, mismatch distributions including the raggedness index were more likely to identify recently bottlenecked populations with this data set. Estimates of population mutation rate (theta), population divergence time (t), and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) from MDIV were similar before and after bottlenecks; however, estimates of gene flow (M) were significantly lower in a few cases following a bottleneck. These results suggest that caution should be used when assessing demographic history from contemporary data sets, as recently fragmented and bottlenecked populations may have lost lineages that affect inferences of their demographic history.","jeffaj@umich.edu",2007,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03285.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","historical-dna","RC","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","terrestrial","Aves","USA,Canada","Alberta, Manitoba, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, Louisiana, South Dakota","1999.01.01,1984.01.01,1970.01.01,1966.01.01,1964.01.01,1958.01.01,1955.01.01,1953.01.01,1948.01.01,1945.01.01,1942.01.01,1941.01.01,1940.01.01,1939.01.01,1938.01.01,1937.01.01,1936.01.01,1935.01.01,1934.01.01,1933.01.01,1932.01.01,1929.01.01,1928.01.01,1927.01.01,1926.01.01,1925.01.01,1923.01.01,1922.01.01,1921.01.01,1920.01.01,1915.01.01,1914.01.01,1912.01.01,1911.01.01,1910.01.01,1909.01.01,1907.01.01,1906.01.01,1905.01.01,1904.01.01,1903.01.01,1902.01.01,1901.01.01,1898.01.01,1897.01.01,1896.01.01,1895.01.01,1893.01.01,1891.01.01,1890.01.01,1888.01.01,1887.01.01,1885.01.01,1884.01.01,1883.01.01,1882.01.01,1880.01.01,1879.01.01,1878.01.01,1862.01.01,1859.01.01,1854.01.01,1847.01.01","250,32,1,2,1,1,1,73,2,3,3,7,3,2,4,4,3,3,3,4,2,6,7,3,2,4,2,3,9,1,7,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3,2,3,1,3,3,2,5,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,7,1,1,1",365,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","skin","dried","Phenol/chloroform + Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","missing date for 1 historic individual.

Though reaching a large size, population abundances (Nc) of Atlantic sturgeon are not easily surveyed using traditional fishery methods because of their relative scarcity and their many age classes, often exhibiting extensive and differential movements that render them not readily amenable to traditional sampling efforts. A metric of their vulnerability to inbreeding and a possible alternative to Nc for abundance monitoring is effective population size (Ne). We surveyed 14 Atlantic sturgeon populations across their range using a suite of DNA microsatellite markers. Contemporary levels of Ne ranged from 1 in the St. Marys River, Florida-Georgia, to 156 in the Hudson River, New York. Historical Ne estimates averaged about 11.5xhigher than contemporary estimates, with a high of 927 for the Kennebec River population. Because of a mix of life history characteristics that make traditional Ne estimates based on imperfectly mixed year classes of juveniles questionable, we propose and provide results ofa new, more robust and diagnostic approach based on sequential cohorts, termed Ne Max. Although contemporary Ne values obtained were at levels that might be considered troublesome, we suggest that the unique life history factors of this species may render it more resistant than other taxa to inbreeding effects. Because of the many differences among populations in size, age, and sex ratio and in harvest histories, we do not believe that a reliable extrapolation factor between Ne and Nc is yet possible. However, ongoing monitoring of Ne and Nc in populations might be sensitive to population changes and could form the basis of determining a relationship between Ne and Nc.","john.waldman@qc.cuny.edu",2019,"10.1007/s10592-018-1121-4","CONSERVATION GENETICS","historical-dna","JW","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","other","Actinopterygii","USA,Canada","Maine, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, New Brunswick, Quebec ","2017.01.01,2016.01.01,2015.01.01,2014.01.01,2013.01.01,2011.01.01,2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,1998.01.01,1996.01.01,1993.01.01,1992.01.01,1980.01.01","169,170,216,487,85,162,50,132,26,32,101,81,53,66,123,19",5110,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","invasive_species","chronic","microsat","skin","ethanol","phenol/chloroform","Sanger","PCR","generation time varies across range + populations sampled","2017.01.01","169","170","216","487","85","162","50","132","26","32","101","81","53","66",123,19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.64481409001957,13515,37.027397260274

We applied genetic monitoring to the reintroduced brown bear population in northern Italy. From 2002 to 2008, 2781 hair and faecal samples collected noninvasively plus 12 samples obtained from captured or dead bears were used to follow the demographic and geographical expansion and changes in genetic composition. Individual genotypes were used to reconstruct the wild pedigree and revealed that the population increased rapidly, from nine founders to > 27 individuals in 2008 (lambda = 1.17-1.19). Spatial mapping of bear samples indicated that most bears were distributed in the region surrounding the translocation site; however, individual bears were found up to 163 km away. Genetic diversity in the population was high, with expected heterozygosity of 0.74-0.79 and allelic richness of 4.55-5.41. However, multi-year genetic monitoring data showed that mortality rates were elevated, immigration did not occur, one dominant male sired all cubs born from 2002 to 2005, genetic diversity declined, relatedness increased, inbreeding occurred, and the effective population size was extremely small (Ne = 3.03, ecological method). The comprehensive information collected through genetic monitoring is critical for implementing future conservation plans for the brown bear population in the Italian Alps. This study provides a model for other reintroduction programmes by demonstrating how genetic monitoring can be implemented to uncover aspects of the demography, ecology and genetics of small and reintroduced populations that will advance our understanding of the processes influencing their viability, evolution, and successful restoration.","mdebarba@uidaho.edu",2010,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04791.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","RC","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","connectivity","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Italy","Trentino","2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01","8,2,12,2,5,6,5",4198,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","","acute","microsat","hair","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","assuming dried preservation - not mentioned in paper.

Many challenges are associated with empirical detection of population declines, thus conservation biologists often use molecular approaches as surrogates. This study explored whether declines in abundances of viviparous sea snakes on Australia's Timor Sea reefs could have been foreshadowed using genetic surveys. Ashmore Reef (the largest Timor Sea reef) once hosted large breeding populations of sea snakes. Abundances have declined precipitously since 1994 and Ashmore Reef has been devoid of snakes since 2012. Moreover, high rates of hybridization between two sympatric species have been documented on Timor Sea reefs, possibly associated with sea snake declines. I analysed mitochondrial DNA and 11 nuclear microsatellites for > 250 sea snakes from three species, Aipysurus laevis, Aipysurus fuscus and Emdocephalus annulatus, sampled on four Timor Sea reefs in 2002 and 2010. While there was strong spatial genetic structure among reefs, there was little temporal genetic divergence for A. laevis at Ashmore Reef, despite the massive declines in abundance during that temporal window. Positive Tajima's D and Fu's Fs values at Ashmore Reef indicated demographic contraction for: A. laevis in 2002 and 2010; E. annulatus (2002); but not A. fuscus (2002). Microsatellites showed inbreeding depression (positive Fis values) and non-random mating (heterozygote deficit) for all three species at Ashmore Reef, consistent with population declines. Bottleneck tests were equivocal, with significant heterozygous excesses at Ashmore Reef, but non-significant M-ratios or mode-shifts in allele frequencies, with the significance of tests differing markedly with microsatellite mutation models. Thus genetic analyses alone would not have been sufficient to provide managers with unequivocal evidence of population declines. There was little evidence for hybridization between A. laevis and A. fuscus, despite previous research suggesting that the Endangered A. fuscus was at risk of reverse speciation secondary to the highly porous reproductive barriers between these species.","Vimoksalehi.lukoschek@jcu.edu.au",2018,"10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.018","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","temporal-genetics","AAS","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","connectivity","","yes","marine","Reptilia","Australia","Timor Sea (Ashmore Reef, Cartier Islet, HIbernia Reef, Scott Reef), Gulf of Carpentaria, Great Barrier Reef","2010.01.01,2002.01.01","42,55",1825,"pre-designed","natural","","","","chronic","mtDNA_seq","scale","ethanol","chloroform","Sanger","PCR","3 species sampled but only had temporal samples with n>3 for each time point.

Longitudinal studies allow the examination of temporal changes in neutral genetic patterns in relation to demographic data, which is particularly interesting in populations that undergo large fluctuations in size. Taking advantage of eight years (2006-2013) of genetic survey data (18 microsatellite loci) from a snow vole (Chionomys nivalis) population in the Swiss Alps, we explore whether and how gene flow and selection shape temporal variability in genetic diversity by counteracting the effect of genetic drift, and thereby maintain the high levels of heterozygosity observed in this population. Using simulations and empirical data, we show that effective population size is small, and that genetic drift would lead to a marked decline in genetic diversity. However, this force is counterbalanced by the restoring effect of immigration. In agreement with the predictions of neutral genetic theory, we found a strong, positive association between genetic diversity and population size, which suggests positive density-dependent dispersal. This is also supported by the observed changes in genetic composition overtime. Meanwhile, selection for heterozygosity was weak, overriding the effect of drift only in one out of eight years. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of gene flow as a significant evolutionary force in shaping genetic patterns in the wild, and as a crucial-process for the maintenance of genetic diversity in small populations.

We conducted temporal genetic analyses of reintroduced populations of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) in Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and the United States (Montana). We used samples collected 4 years apart, 17 years from the initiation of the reintroduction, and 3 years after the conclusion of releases. To assess program success, we genotyped 304 hair samples, subsampled from the known range in 2000 and 2001, and 2005 and 2006, at 7 microsatellite loci. We compared diversity, effective population size, and genetic connectivity over time in each population. Diversity remained stable over time and there was evidence of increasing effective population size. We determined population structure in both periods after correcting for differences in sample sizes. The geographic distribution of these populations roughly corresponded with the original release locations, which suggests the release sites had residual effects on the population structure. However, given that both reintroduction sites had similar source populations, habitat fragmentation, due to cropland, may be associated with the population structure we found. Although our results indicate growing, stable populations, future connectivity analyses are warranted to ensure both populations are not subject to negative small-population effects. Our results demonstrate the importance of multiple sampling years to fully capture population dynamics of reintroduced populations.","cathy.cullingham@ualberta.ca",2013,"10.1111/cobi.12122","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","temporal-genetics","JW","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","connectivity","diversity","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","USA,Canada","Montana, Alberta, Saskatchewan","2006.01.01,2001.01.01","193,111",730,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","","acute","microsat","hair","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","","2006.01.01","193","111",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA","Canada",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.5013698630137,1826,5.0027397260274

However, comparative studies that gauge the relative performance of N-e, N(e)m or m methods are few. Using temporal genetic data from two salmonid fish population systems with disparate population structure, we (i) evaluated the congruence in estimates and precision of long- and short-term N-e, N(e)m and m from six methods; (ii) explored the effects of metapopulation structure on N-e estimation in one system with spatiotemporally linked subpopulations, using three approaches; and (iii) determined to what degree interpopulation gene flow was asymmetric over time. We found that long-term N-e estimates exceeded short-term N-e within populations by 2-10 times; the two were correlated in the system with temporally stable structure (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar) but not in the highly dynamic system (brown trout, Salmo trutta). Four temporal methods yielded short-term N-e estimates within populations that were strongly correlated, and these were higher but more variable within salmon populations than within trout populations. In trout populations, however, these short-term N-e estimates were always lower when assuming gene flow than when assuming no gene flow. Linkage disequilibrium data generally yielded short-term N-e estimates of the same magnitude as temporal methods in both systems, but the two were uncorrelated. Correlations between long- and short-term geneflow estimates were inconsistent between methods, and their relative size varied up to eightfold within systems. While asymmetries in gene flow were common in both systems (58-63% of population-pair comparisons), they were only temporally stable in direction within certain salmon population pairs, suggesting that gene flow between particular populations is often intermittent and/or variable. Exploratory metapopulation N-e analyses in trout demonstrated both the importance of spatial scale in estimating N-e and the role of gene flow in maintaining genetic variability within subpopulations. Collectively, our results illustrate the utility of comparatively applying N-e, N(e)m and m to (i) tease apart processes implicated in population structure, (ii) assess the degree of continuity in patterns of connectivity between population pairs and (iii) gauge the relative performance of different approaches, such as the influence of population subdivision and gene flow on N-e estimation. They further reiterate the importance of temporal sampling replication in population genetics, the value of interpreting N-e or m in light of species biology, and the need to address long-standing assumptions of current N-e, N(e)m or m models more explicitly in future research.","dylan.fraser@dal.ca",2007,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03453.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","BR","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","connectivity","","","no","marine","Actinopterygii","Canada,Denmark","","","",NA,"opportunistic","natural","","","","chronic","microsat","scale","dried","Pro K","Sanger","PCR","multiple sampling schemes with some populations only having 1 sample, others have multiple; they used 6 different methods for estimating metrics; multiple extraction types: (Tessier 1999, pro K (Estoup 1996); Ostergaard 2003, Chelex resin (Estoup 1996); Hansen 2002, phenol-chlorophorm (Nielsen 1999) and/or proK-chelex (Estoup 1996));",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada","Denmark",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reintroduction of pregnant females has been proposed as a means of maximising productivity and genetic diversity, but it is unclear whether the release of pregnant females increases the effective number of founders. Ten male and 20 gravid female egg-laying skinks (Oligosoma suteri) were reintroduced to Korapuki Island from Green Island, New Zealand in 1992. We sampled the populations on both Green and Korapuki Islands to examine the effect of reintroduction on the genetic structure and fitness of egg-laying skinks following release. The population on Korapuki Island showed multiple genetic signatures of a bottleneck that were not detected in the population on Green Island. At the individual level, juveniles on Korapuki Island were more homozygous than adults on Korapuki and Green Islands. However, we did not find evidence of inbreeding depression using two performance-based surrogates of fitness. Further, the population on Korapuki Island had a significantly larger effective population size than would have been expected by reintroduction of 30 skinks, based on 10,000 simulated populations. The reintroduction of gravid females aided in increasing the effective number of founders, and may be a viable option for maximizing genetic diversity in reintroduced populations, particularly for long-lived species. However, the continued loss of genetic variation in reintroduced populations may have more insidious long-term consequences, such as the loss of adaptive potential, which cannot be assessed in the short-term.","Kim.Miller@sci.monash.edu.au",2011,"10.1007/s10592-010-0154-0","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","RC","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Reptilia","NewZealand","Green island, Korapuki island, Korapuki island","2007.01.01,2006.01.01,1999-1996.01.01","53,185,15",1095,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","invasive_species","","","acute","microsat","scale","ethanol","phenol/chloroform","Sanger","PCR","samples are grouped oddly and might combined historical and contemporary into 1 group; driver not really invasive, they were extirpated bc of invasives and then reintroduced, but the historical comparisons are between reintroduced and source pops, not with before and after invasive species","2007.01.01","53","185","15",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NewZealand",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.333333333333333,365,1

Here, we investigate the impact of unstable population size and connectivity on genetic diversity and structure in a long-term genetic study of 298 Finnish wolves born in 19952009 and genotyped for 17 microsatellite loci. During the initial recovery and prior to population expansion, genetic diversity was high (19951997: LD-Ne=67.2; Ho=0.749; He=0.709) despite a small census size and low number of breeders (Nc<100; Nb<10) likely reflecting the status of the Russian source population. Surprisingly, observed heterozygosity decreased significantly during the study period (t=-2.643, P=0.021) despite population expansion, likely a result of an increase in inbreeding (FIS=0.108 in 20072009) owing to a low degree of connectivity with adjacent Russian wolf population (m=0.0160.090; FST=0.086, P<0.001) and population crash after 2006. However, population growth had a temporary positive impact on Ne and number of family lines. This study shows that even strong population growth alone might not be adequate to retain genetic diversity, especially when accompanied with low amount of subsequent gene flow and population decline.","eeva.roininen@oulu.fi",2012,"10.1111/mec.12010","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","AAS","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Finland,Russia","Republic of Karelia,Finland,Finland,Finland,Finland,Finland","2010-2009.01.01,2009-2007.01.01,2006-2004.01.01,2003-2001.01.01,2000-1998.01.01,1997-1995.01.01","10,33,87,83,51,43",1241,"opportunistic","natural","","","","acute","microsat","","","","Sanger","PCR","Sampling scheme in table 1; Use multiple sample and extraction types and do not differentiate which samples were used for historical samples (tissue, hair, buccal swab; phenol-chloroform and Qiagen for tissues, Chelex for hair) ","2010-2009.01.01","10","33","87","83","51","43",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland","Russia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, effective population size (N-e) estimates are useful for determining the conservation status of species, yet accurate estimates of current N-e remain difficult to obtain. The effective population size can contribute to setting federal delisting criteria, as was done for the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). After being hunted to near extinction during the North Pacific fur trade, the southern sea otter has recovered over part of its former range, but remains at relatively low numbers, making it desirable to obtain accurate and consistent estimates of N-e. Although theoretical papers have compared the validity of several methods, comparisons of estimators using empirical data in applied conservation settings are limited. We combined thirteen years of demographic and genetic data from 1,006 sea otters to assess multiple N-e estimators, as well as temporal trends in genetic diversity and population genetic structure. Genetic diversity was low and did not increase over time. There was no evidence for distinct genetic units, but some evidence for genetic isolation by distance. In particular, estimates of N-e based on demographic data were much larger than genetic estimates when computed for the entire range of the population, but were similar at smaller spatial scales. The discrepancy between estimates at large spatial scales could be driven by cryptic population structure and/or individual differences in reproductive success. We recommend the development of new delisting criteria for the southern sea otter. We advise the use of multiple estimates of N-e for other wide-ranging species, species with overlapping generations, or with sex-biased dispersal, as well as the development of improved metrics of genetic assessments of populations.","Holly.Ernest@uwyo.edu",2018,"10.1111/eva.12642","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","temporal-genetics","RC","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","marine","Mammalia","USA","","2010.01.01,2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,2002.01.01,2001.01.01,2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01","35,74,73,79,79,67,84,156,86,72,27,38,16",2883.5,"opportunistic","natural","","","","acute","microsat","","","","Sanger","PCR","Does not give locations sampled; Multiple sampling and extraction schemes with no delineation of historical samples (muscle, blood, hair, buccal swab; Qiagen for blood and tissue; QIAmp for hair and buccal swab)","2010.01.01","35","74","73","79","79","67","84","156","86","72","27","38","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.52002774406104,4383,12.0082191780822

To make predictions there must be an understanding of the relationship between census size, the effective number of breeders (N-b) and effective population size (N-e). We evaluate the temporal genetic variation between three populations of Ambystoma salamanders, and compare genetic and demographic estimates of N-b and N-e. We sampled two wetlands, RB and GB for A. opacum and sampled A. talpoideum at RB, over a 20-year period. Ambystoma opacum colonized the RB wetland in 1980 and the population has steadily expanded as A. talpoideum has declined towards local extinction; the GB population of A. opacum has remained relatively large and stable over this same time period. Genetic variation at 10 microsatellites remained stable at each population over the sampled time frame, and did not reflect changes in population size. Genetic estimates of N-b also did not reflect demographic trends, and were lower than demographic estimates of N-b. Genetic methods of determining N-e gave similar estimates to demographic methods. Our findings indicate that sample sizes and number of markers typically used in genetic studies do not provide enough precision to monitor population size changes in amphibians, which likely violate many of the assumptions of N-b and N-e estimation models. These findings should be considered when using N-e in conservation and management assessments of amphibian populations.","schyler.nunziata@uky.edu",2015,"10.1007/s10592-015-0743-z","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","BR","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Amphibia","USA","RainbowBay,RainbowBay,RainbowBay,GingersBay,GingersBay,GingersBay,RainbowBay.GingersBay","2010.01.01,2001.01.01.1998.01.01,1997.01.01,1996.01.01,1995.01.01,1993.01.01","24,20,24,12,24,24,28.24",NA,"pre-designed","natural","","","","","microsat","muscle","frozen","Chelex/Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","Species: Ambystoma opacum; Predesigned study in that they did all the work themselves over a 20-year period but the goal of the study was not likely formed from the outset","2010.01.01","24","20","24","12","24","24","28.24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6209,17.0109589041096

One proposed application of genetic monitoring has been to estimate abundance and its trajectory through time. Here, genetic monitoring was conducted across five consecutive year for the Pecos bluntnose shiner, a federally threatened minnow. Temporal changes in allele frequencies at seven microsatellite DNA loci were used to estimate variance effective size (N-eV) across adjacent years in the time series. Likewise, effective size was computed using the linkage disequilibrium method (N-eD) for each sample. Estimates of N-e were then compared to estimates of adult fish density obtained from traditional demographic monitoring. For Pecos bluntnose shiner, density (catch-per-unit-effort), N-eV and N-eD were positively associated across this time series. Results for Pecos bluntnose shiner were compared to a related and ecologically similar species, the Rio Grande silvery minnow. In this species, density and N-eV were negatively associated, which suggested decoupling of abundance and effective size trajectories. Conversely, density and N-eD were positively associated. For Rio Grande silvery minnow, discrepancies among estimates of N-e and their relationships with adult fish density could be related to effects of high variance in reproductive success in the wild and/or effects of supplementation of the wild population with captive-bred and reared fish. The efficacy of N-e as a predictor of density and abundance may depend on intrinsic population dynamics of the species and how these dynamics are influenced by the landscape features, management protocols and other factors.","mosborne@unm.edu",2010,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04695.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","museum-dna","AAS","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","freshwater","Actinopterygii","USA","New Mexico","2009.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2002.01.01","331,252,338,139,22,172,107",496,"pre-designed","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","env_variation","","chronic","microsat","skin","ethanol","phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","","2009.01.01","331","252","338","139","22","172","107",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5.15524193548387,2557,7.00547945205479

However, tracing its change through time is difficult in natural populations. We applied four new methods for estimating Ne from a single sample of genotypes to trace temporal change in Ne for bears in the Northern Dinaric Mountains. We genotyped 510 bears using 20 microsatellite loci and determined their age. The samples were organized into cohorts with regard to the year when the animals were born and yearly samples with age categories for every year when they were alive. We used the Estimator by Parentage Assignment (EPA) to directly estimate both Ne and generation interval for each yearly sample. For cohorts, we estimated the effective number of breeders (Nb) using linkage disequilibrium, sibship assignment and approximate Bayesian computation methods and extrapolated these estimates to Ne using the generation interval. The Ne estimate by EPA is 276 (183350 95% CI), meeting the inbreeding-avoidance criterion of Ne > 50 but short of the long-term minimum viable population goal of Ne > 500. The results obtained by the other methods are highly consistent with this result, and all indicate a rapid increase in Ne probably in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The new single-sample approaches to the estimation of Ne provide efficient means for including Ne in monitoring frameworks and will be of great importance for future management and conservation.","tomaz.skrbinsek@gmail.com",2012,"10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05423.x","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","RC","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Slovenia","Northern Dinaric Mountains","2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2006.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01,1999.01.01","78,104,116,84,76,51,1",2763,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","","","chronic","microsat","muscle","ethanol","GeneElute Mammalian Genomics DNA kit","Sanger","PCR","Assuming muscle tissue and ethanol - paper just says """"""""tissue"""""""", no preservation method.

Apennine brown bears Ursus arctos marsicanus are a small, isolated population under a severe risk of extinction, for which the main demographic mechanisms underlying population dynamics are still unknown, and population trends have not been formally assessed. We present a 12-year analysis of their survival rates using non-invasive genetic sampling data collected through four different sampling techniques. By using multi-event capture-recapture models, we estimated survival probabilities for two broadly defined age classes (cubs and older individuals), even though the age of the majority of sampled bears was unknown. We also applied the Pradel model to provide a preliminary assessment of population trend during the study period. Survival was different between cubs [I center dot = 0.51, 95% CI (0.22, 0.79)], adult males [I center dot = 0.85, 95% CI (0.76, 0.91)] and adult females [I center dot = 0.92, 95% CI (0.87, 0.95)], no temporal variation in survival emerged, suggesting that bear survival remained substantially stable throughout the study period. The Pradel analysis of population trend yielded an estimate of lambda = 1.009 [SE = 0.018; 95% CI (0.974, 1.046)]. Our results indicate that, despite the status of full legal protection, the basically stable demography of this relict population is compatible with the observed lack of range expansion, and that a relatively high cub mortality could be among the main factors depressing recruitment and hence population growth.","vincenzo.gervasi@libero.it",2017,"10.1007/s10144-017-0587-0","POPULATION ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","EG","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Italy","Central Appenines","2014.01.01,2011.01.01,2008.01.01,2007.01.01,2005.01.01,2004.01.01,2003.01.01","15,22,1,3,12,18,17",2763,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","human_exploitation","habitat_loss","","chronic","microsat","hair","dried","???","Sanger","PCR","Non-invasive sampling, sample #s are # of new individuals detected/year.

This population constitutes an ideal model to document a founder event and ensuing genetic drift, with implications for conservation. Here we combined historical accounts, census and tagging data since the late 1960s, and genetic data (41 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences) from 84 individuals representing nearly all individuals present between 1990 and 2000 to investigate the history of the founding of the White Island population, document its population dynamics and evaluate possible future threats. We fully resolved parental relationships over three overlapping generations. Cytonuclear disequilibrium among the first generation suggested that it comprised the direct descendants of a founding group. We estimated that the White Island population was founded by a small group of individuals that accessed the island during a brief break in the surrounding sea ice in the mid-1950s, consistent with historical accounts. Direct and indirect methods of calculating effective population size were highly congruent and suggested a minimum founding group consisting of three females and two males. The White Island population showed altered reproductive dynamics compared to Erebus Bay, including highly skewed sex ratio, documented inbred mating events, and the oldest known reproducing Weddell seals. A comparison with the putative source population showed that the White Island population has an effective inbreeding coefficient (F (e)) of 0.29. Based on a pedigree analysis including the hypothesized founding group, 86% of the individuals for whom parents were known had inbreeding coefficients ranging 0.09-0.31. This high level of inbreeding was correlated with reduced pup survival. Seals at White Island therefore face the combined effects of low genetic variability, lack of immigration, and inbreeding depression. Ultimately, this study provides evidence of the effects of natural isolation on a large, long-lived vertebrate and can provide clues to the potential effects of anthropogenic-caused isolation of similar taxa.","Tom.Gelatt@noaa.gov; idelisle@ualberta.ca",2010,"10.1007/s10592-009-9856-6","CONSERVATION GENETICS","historical-dna","KJ","Brendan","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","marine","Mammalia","Antarctica","White Island","2000.01.01,1999.01.01,1998.01.01,1997.01.01,1996.01.01,1995.01.01,1994.01.01,1993.01.01,1992.01.01,1991.01.01,1990.01.01,1989.01.01,1988.01.01","10,6,9,7,7,3,5,3,5,2,1,8,18",3285,"opportunistic","natural","","","","","microsat","hair","frozen","QIAamp columns","Sanger","PCR","Article is very sketchy w/r/t sampling (""""""""dermal or blood samples""""""""), preservation (maybe frozen b/c Antarctica?).

The N-e, results confirm that. despite a marked reduction between 1966 and 1997 and a less than optimal status, the Trasimeno population shows a positive trend in its health status, presumably due to proper management programmes.

This amphibian breeds in temporary pools where survival rates can vary among families. Census population sizes (N) were derived from spawn string counts. Point and coalescent-based maximum likelihood estimates of Ne based on microsatellite allele distributions were similar. N-e/N ratios based on genetic estimates of Ne ranged between 0.02 and 0.20. Mean demographic estimates of Ne were consistently higher (2.7-8.0-fold) than genetic estimates for all three populations when variance in breeding success was evaluated at the point where females no longer influence their progeny. However, discrepancies between genetic and demographic estimators could be removed by using a model that included extra variance in survivorship (above to Poisson expectations) among families. The implications of these results for the estimation of N-e in wild populations are discussed.","t.j.c.beebee@sussex.ac.uk",2004,"10.1023/B:COGE.0000031145.06421.d3","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","KJ","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","terrestrial","Amphibia","England","Ainsdale.Saltfleetby, Ainsdale.Saltfleetby","2000.01.01,1994.01.01","80,40",1642.5,"pre-designed","natural","","","","acute","microsat","","ethanol","Chelex","Sanger","PCR","whole larvae used for extractions; no driver just comparisons of different populations for NE estimates","2000.01.01","80","40",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UK",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.33394216133942,2191,6.0027397260274
"190",228,3113,NA,"Estimating effective population size of guanacos in Patagonia: an integrative approach for wildlife conservation","Sarno, RJ; Jennings, DE; Franklin, WL","By the mid-1900s the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) approached extinction in southern South America due to habitat destruction and hunting. In order to maintain the ecological prominence of this iconic species, as well as assist in the management of populations that are emerging economically while increasing in conservation value, accurate and potentially rapid estimates of effective population size (N-e) (demographic and/or genetic) are essential. Estimates of N-e generally focus on the genetic effective population size; however, we posited that both parameters may be necessary to provide more accurate and timely estimates. Therefore, we examined the performance of three demographic and four genetic estimators of N-e of guanacos in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, at different years and time intervals between 1987 and 1997. We compared our estimates with census estimates of the adult population size (N-ac) during the same time period. Average N-e/N-ac ratios of demographic estimates varied between 0.04 and 0.99 of the adult census size. Genetic estimates varied between 0.02 and 0.08 of the adult census size. Based upon group composition and population size (n = 82) of guanacos in 1975, the number of breeding adults was 44 animals. Mean N-e of the single-sample and temporal genetic estimators was 43.1, and 34.3, respectively; estimated N-e of one of the demographic estimators was 41. Our findings suggest that intermittent genetic estimates of N-e (via fecal samples, carcasses, blood collection during capture, and/or other non-invasive methods) can provide crucial information regarding the genetic integrity of increasingly isolated populations of wild South American camelids. Considering the overall performance of these estimators, and differences in how each functions, we recommend an integrative approach using both genetic and demographic estimators, to evaluate N-e for the wild South American camelids and other species with polygynous mating systems.","Ronald.Sarno@hofstra.edu",2015,"10.1007/s10592-015-0730-4","CONSERVATION GENETICS","temporal-genetics","KJ","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Chile","Torres del Paine National Park","","",NA,"opportunistic","natural","","","","","microsat","blood","ethanol","phenol-chloroform","Sanger","PCR","they cite another article for microsat data, but the sample sizes are different than the paper, and they do not say how many samples they used from each cohort; no driver mentioned",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chile",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reliable estimates of population parameters are often necessary for conservation management but these are hard to obtain for elusive, rare and wide-ranging species such as wolves Canis lupus. This species has naturally recolonized parts of its former habitat in Western Europe; however, an accurate and cost-effective method to assess population trend and survival has not been implemented yet. 2. We used open-model capture-recapture (CR) sampling with non-invasive individual identifications derived from faecal genotyping to estimate survival and trend in abundance for wolves in the Western Alps between 1999 and 2006. Our sampling strategy reduced individual heterogeneity in recaptures, thus minimizing bias and increasing the precision of the estimates. 3. Young wolves had lower apparent annual survival rates (0.24 +/- 0.06) than adult wolves (0.82 +/- 0.04); survival rates were lower in the summer than in the winter for both young and adults. The wolf population in the study area increased from 21 +/- 9.6 wolves in 1999 to 47 +/- 11.2 wolves in late winter 2005; the population growth rate (lambda = 1.04 +/- 0.27) was lower than that recorded for other recolonizing wolf populations. 4. We found a positive trend in wolf abundance, regardless of the method used. However, the abundance estimate based on snow-tracking was on average 36.2% (SD = 13.6%) lower than that from CR modelling, because young dispersing wolves are likely to have lower sign detection rates in snow-track surveys, a problem adequately addressed by CR sampling. 5. Synthesis and applications. We successfully implemented a new method to assess large carnivore population trend and survival at large spatial scales. These are the first such estimates for wolves in Italy and in the Alps and have important management implications. Our approach can be widely applied to broader spatial and temporal scales for other elusive and wide-ranging species in Europe and elsewhere.","francesca.marucco@centrograndicarnivori.it",2009,"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01696.x","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","temporal-genetics","KJ","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","","","","no","terrestrial","Mammalia","Italy,France","","","",NA,"pre-designed","natural","","","","","microsat","","ethanol","Qiagen and QIAmp","Sanger","PCR","samples were scat; no driver, basically proof of method",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Italy","France",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Temporal population genetic data can be a powerful tool for testing the presence and severity of reductions in N-e. The Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) is a flagship for conservation of Australian monsoonal savanna species. This species underwent severe population declines in the twentieth century due to land use changes associated with European colonization. Microsatellite and mitochondrial genetic data from Gouldian finch samples sourced from natural history collections prior to land use changes were compared with contemporary samples to estimate the severity of decline in effective population size and to detect changes in gene flow. These data show that Gouldian finch decline was not as severe as some sources suggest, and that population genetic connectivity has not changed following land use changes in the twentieth century. Multiple estimators of current N-e using genetic data from consecutive years suggest the Gouldian finch N-e is likely between a few hundred and a few thousand individuals, with some estimates within the range considered of conservation concern. This work has identified the need to genetically characterize populations in Queensland, and to understand critical demographic parameters (e.g. lifespan) in the Gouldian finch. Understanding these factors is vital to further improve genetic estimates of population size, key to the formation of appropriate conservation management of this species.","peri.bolton@mq.edu.au",2018,"10.1007/s10592-018-1051-1","CONSERVATION GENETICS","ancient-dna","BR","Kyle","accept","accept","empirical","popsize","diversity","","","no","terrestrial","Aves","Australia","","","",NA,"opportunistic","anthropogenic","habitat_loss","","","chronic","microsat","skin","dried","Qiagen","Sanger","PCR","see table 1, complicated sampling scheme and cannot decipher which periods and sample types were used for temporal genetic analyses",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
